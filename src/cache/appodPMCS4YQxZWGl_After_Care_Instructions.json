This causes them to close even more tightly.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Pimple Opening:</strong><ul><li>Opening (popping) pimples is not advised by doctors. But, most teens and adults do it anyway. The key is doing it safely.</li><li>Never open a pimple before it has come to a head.</li><li>Wash your face and hands first.</li><li>Use a sterile needle (cleaned with rubbing alcohol). Nick the surface of the yellow pimple with the tip of the needle. The pus should run out without squeezing.</li><li>Wipe away the pus and wash the area with soap and water.</li><li>This should help it heal faster.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Prevention: Avoid Triggers of Acne:</strong><ul><li>Avoid picking and squeezing. Picking keeps acne from healing. Squeezing causes bleeding into the skin and blotches that can last a month.</li><li>Avoid squeezing boils or other large, red, tender bumps. Reason: can cause a serious face infection.</li><li>Avoid putting any oily or greasy substances on your face. Reason: They block oil glands and make acne worse. If you use cosmetics, use water-based cosmetics.</li><li>Avoid hair tonics or hair creams (especially greasy ones). When you sweat, they will get on the face and irritate the acne.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>With treatment, new whiteheads and blackheads will decrease after 6 to 8 weeks.</li><li>Acne will last through the teen years or later.</li><li>So, you will need to continue the treatment for several years.</li><li>You don't need to worry about scarring. It is very rare for acne to leave any scars.</li></ul></div>\n",

No risk of infection.</li><li><strong>Scrape (Abrasion) or Scratch.</strong> A wound that doesn't go all the way through the skin. Low chance of infection. Antibiotic drugs are not needed.</li><li><strong>Laceration (cut).</strong> A wound that goes through the skin to the fat or muscle tissue. Some chance of infection. Most need to be seen. Cleaning the wound can help prevent this. Antibiotic drugs may be needed.</li><li><strong>Puncture Wound.</strong> Greater risk of infection. Puncture wounds from cat bites are more likely to get infected. Antibiotic drugs may be needed.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Causes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Bites from Wild Animals.</strong> Some wild animals can have rabies. Rabies is a disease that can kill people. Bites or scratches from any large wild animal can pass on rabies. Animals at highest risk for rabies are bats, skunks, raccoons, foxes, and coyotes. These animals may spread rabies even if they have no symptoms. </li><li><strong>Bats.</strong> In the U.S., 90% of cases of rabies in humans are caused by bats. Bats have spread rabies without a visible bite mark. Any contact with a bat requires a call to your child's doctor.</li><li><strong>Small Wild Animal Bites.</strong> Small animals such as mice, rats, moles, or gophers do not carry rabies. Chipmunks, prairie dogs, squirrels and rabbits also do not carry rabies. Sometimes, their bites can get infected.</li><li><strong>Large Pet Animal Bites.</strong> Most bites from pets are from dogs or cats. Dogs and cats are free of rabies in most cities. Stray animals are always at risk for rabies until proven otherwise. Cats and dogs that always stay indoors are free of rabies. The main risk in pet bites is wound infection, not rabies. Cat bites become infected more often than dog bites. Cat scratches can get infected just like a bite because cats lick their claws.</li><li><strong>Small Indoor Pet Animal Bites.</strong> Small indoor pets are at no risk for rabies. Examples of these pets are gerbils, hamsters, guinea pigs, or mice. Tiny puncture wounds from these small animals also don't need to be seen. They carry a very small risk for wound infections.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Bites from Pets</strong></p><ul><li>Provide adult supervision around dogs and cats. Very important for young children.</li><li>Teach your child to never approach a dog that is feeding.</li></ul>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Cause in General</strong></p><ul><li>How much a child chooses to eat is controlled by the brain's appetite center. Kids will eat as much as they need to for growth and energy.</li><li>Their appetites are normal if they have good energy levels and are growing normally.</li><li>Many parents try to force their child to eat more than they need to. They fear that poor appetite may lead to bigger health problems. This is not true. Forced feedings actually decrease a child's appetite.</li><li>Some parents try to make a short child eat more in hopes he will grow taller.  This is impossible because genes determine height.  Extra calories will just make him fatter.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Cause in Toddlers</strong></p><ul><li>During their first year, babies grow rapidly. They gain 15 or more pounds.</li><li>Between 1 and 5 years of age many children normally gain only 4 or 5 pounds each year. They can normally go 3 or 4 months without any weight gain.</li><li>Because they are not growing as fast, they need less calories. Many toddlers have a poor appetite. All of this is normal.</li><li>The medical term for this is physiological anorexia of toddlers.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><ul><li>Allow your child to be in charge of how much they eat. Once this happens, mealtime battles should end.</li><li>After a month, your concerns about your child's health also should disappear.</li><li>Your child's appetite will improve when she becomes older and needs to eat more. It will also increase during normal growth spurts.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Feeding Mistakes</strong></p><ul><li>Parents often are worried that their child isn't eating enough. This may start some irrational patterns of feeding. Avoid all of the following:</li><li>Forced feeding is the most common mistake. The parent picks up the child's spoon or fork. Then, they try various ways to get food into the child's mouth. This always causes decreased appetite. It can also cause vomiting. It also hurts the parent child relationship.</li><li>Giving the child high calorie drinks, such as Ensure. That will decrease the intake of regular foods.</li><li>Offering snacks at 1 hour intervals throughout the day. Giving snacks that are larger than a regular meal.</li><li>Forcing the child to sit at the table after the meal has ended.</li><li>Awakening the child at night to feed her. Then she won't be hungry at breakfast.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Feeding Battles</strong></p><ul><li>Prevent feeding struggles by teaching your child to feed themselves as early as possible.</li><li>By 6 to 8 months old, start giving her finger foods. Such foods allow your child to feed herself at least some of the time. Finger foods can be used when she is not yet able to use a spoon.</li><li>By 12 months of age, your child will begin to use a spoon.</li><li>She should be able to feed herself completely by 15 months of age.</li><li>When feeding infants, wait for them to show you they are ready to eat. For example, they may lean forward. Let her pace the feeding herself (for example, by turning her head). Do not put food into a child's mouth just because she has opened it.</li><li>Your child doesn't need to empty the bottle or finish the baby food jar. Plates do not need to be fully cleaned off either.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Put Your Child in Charge of How Much He Eats at Mealtime:</strong> <ul><li>Trust your child's appetite center. Children eat as much as they need. Your child's brain will ensure he eats enough calories for normal energy and growth.</li><li>Serve well-balanced meals. If your child is hungry, he will eat. If he's not, he will be by the next meal.</li><li>Even skipping an occasional meal is harmless.</li><li>Just reminding him to eat or to eat more will work against you.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Allow One Small Snack Between Meals:</strong><ul><li>Some children who never seem hungry may be eating too many snacks. Excessive snacking is the most common reason children don't eat at mealtime. They never become truly hungry. </li><li>Be sure your child arrives at mealtime with an empty stomach. </li><li>Offer your child no more than two small snacks of nutritious food each day. Provide them only if your child requests them. </li><li>Keep the snack size small. Limit to 1/3 of what you would expect him to eat at mealtime. </li><li>If your child is thirsty between meals, offer water.</li><li>Limit the amount of juice your child drinks to less than 6 ounces each day. </li><li>Let your child miss snacks if she chooses and then watch the appetite return. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Never Feed Your Child if He is Capable of Feeding Himself:</strong><ul><li>Parents of children with poor appetites may feel they have to force feed. You pick up your child's spoon or fork. You try to get food into their mouth while smiling and playing tricks. Forced feeding is the main cause of feeding power struggles. </li><li>By 12 to 15 months, children are old enough to use a spoon by themselves. Once this happens, never again pick it up for them. </li><li>If your child is hungry, they will feed themselves. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Limit Milk to 16 Ounces Each Day: </strong><ul><li>Milk contains as many calories as most solid foods. Drinking too much milk or juice can fill kids up and dull their appetites. </li><li>If your child is thirsty, offer water.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Serve Small Portions of Food (Less than You Think Your Child Will Eat):</strong><ul><li>Don't serve your child more food than she could possibly eat. This will decrease your child's appetite. </li><li>Instead, serve your child a small amount on a large plate. She will be more likely to finish it and gain a sense of accomplishment. </li><li>If your child seems to want more, wait for her to ask for it. </li><li>Avoid serving your child any foods that she strongly dislikes (such as some vegetables).</li></ul></div><div><strong>Make Mealtimes Pleasant:</strong><ul><li>Draw your children into friendly conversation. Talk about fun subjects.</li><li>Don't discuss how little your child eats in her presence. Trust your child's appetite center to look after her food needs. </li><li>Also, don't praise your child for eating more. Children should eat to satisfy their appetite, not to please the parent. If your mealtimes are a battleground, change your expectations.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Extend Mealtime:</strong><ul><li>Don't make your child sit at the dinner table after everyone else is done. This will only cause your child to develop unpleasant feelings about mealtime.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Consider Giving Your Child Daily Vitamins: </strong><ul><li>Although vitamins are probably not needed, they are harmless in normal dosages.</li><li>Giving them may help you relax about your child's eating patterns.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Causes</strong></p><ul><li>Tooth decay occurs when sugar in liquids is in contact with the teeth for a prolonged time. Milk, formula, juice, Kool-Aid, and soft drinks all contain sugar. If a child falls asleep with a bottle in the mouth, the sugar coats the upper teeth. This can also occur if he constantly drinks from a bottle during the day. The normal bacteria in the mouth change the sugar to an acid. The enamel is the protective coating of the teeth. In baby teeth, it is only half the thickness of an eggshell. The acid gradually dissolves the enamel and allows decay to occur in the teeth.</li><li>Here are the 3 most common mistakes: Leaving a baby with a bottle of formula or juice to help them go to sleep at night. Using the bottle to deal with middle-of-the-night crying. Using the bottle to deal with fussiness during the day. Many parents are unaware that these bottle habits lead to tooth decay problems.</li><li>Caution: Too much contact with a sippy cup can also cause tooth decay.</li><li>Fruit juice in a bottle is a common cause of BBTD. Don't allow fruit juice before 1 year of age (American Academy of Pediatrics). Exception: needed for symptoms such as constipation.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Why Prevention is Important</strong></p><ul><li>Treatment of BBTD is not easy. It requires general anesthesia and hours of dental work.</li><li>If the problem is detected at an early stage, the teeth can be covered with stainless steel caps.</li><li>If the decay is severe, the decayed teeth will need to be pulled out.</li><li>That's why prevention of BBTD is so important.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Never Give Your Baby a Crib Bottle:</strong><ul><li>Don't let your baby fall asleep with a bottle of milk in his mouth. Don't use the bottle as a pacifier.</li><li>Separate the last bottle-feeding of the evening from bedtime and going into the crib. Make feeding the first step in the bedtime ritual. Then read a book. Then put them in the crib. For best results, feed them in a different room, not in their crib room. </li><li>Baby teeth don't start coming in until 6 months. It's wise to not start a bad habit before then.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Allow Your Toddler to Carry Around a Bottle During the Day:</strong><ul><li>This is called a tote or companion bottle. It causes habit-drinking (comfort-drinking)</li><li>Don't use the bottle as a security object or toy.</li><li>Give a bottle only during mealtimes.</li><li>The same goes for a sippy cup, which can cause similar tooth decay.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Let Your Baby Think the Bottle Belongs to Him:</strong><ul><li>Reason: If you do, it won't be easy to get it back.</li><li>That's why you should hold your baby when you bottle feed him.</li><li>Pretend you own the bottles and this is only a way to feed him.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Introduce a Sippy Cup by 6 Months of Age:</strong><ul><li>Introducing a cup is the best way to prevent bottle dependency. Don't expect a child to start weaning himself unless he has been exposed to a cup.</li><li>Also, don't expect weaning to occur in 1 day or 1 week. It takes several months. A child learns to slowly prefer the cup over the bottle.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Fill Bottles with Water for Severe Bottle Habits:</strong><ul><li>If your baby won't give up the bottle, fill it only with water.</li><li>Water cannot hurt tooth enamel. Water is also boring and will help your child eventually give up the bottle. The bottle itself is not harmful.</li><li>If he complains, hold him and comfort him.</li></ul></div>\n",

There are 200 muscles in the back that allow us to stand upright. </li><li>Triggers are carrying something too heavy or lifting from an awkward position. Bending too far backward or sideways can cause back pain. Digging in the garden for too long causes overuse of back muscles.</li><li>In school age children, heavy backpacks have become a common cause. They also can cause shoulder and neck pains. Children who have not gone into puberty are at greater risk. Reason: they lack the muscle mass.</li><li>Sciatica is pain caused by a pinched nerve in the lower back. Sciatica gives a burning pain in the buttock without back pain. The pain shoots into the back of the leg. The most intense pain can be in the lower leg and foot. Leg weakness, numbness or tingling can also occur. Sciatica is rare in children but common in adults.</li><li>Hard coughing can cause pain in the upper back</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Symptoms of Strained Back Muscles</strong></p><ul><li>The pain is in the middle or lower back </li><li>The pain is made worse by bending </li><li>The muscles near the spine are tender to the touch</li><li>The muscles may be tight (in spasm)</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Pain Scale</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Mild: </strong>Your child feels pain and tells you about it. But, the pain does not keep your child from any normal activities. School, play and sleep are not changed.</li><li><strong>Moderate: </strong>The pain keeps your child from doing some normal activities. It may wake him or her up from sleep.</li><li><strong>Severe:</strong> The pain is very bad. It keeps your child from doing all normal activities. </li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong> <ul><li>Most back pain is caused by carrying heavy objects. The main trigger in school age children is heavy backpacks.</li><li>Lifting a heavy object while the back is twisted is also a common cause.</li><li>Both of these cause strained back muscles (also called muscle overuse).</li><li>Pain is not the only symptom. Walking a little bent over or stiff may occur for a few days.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Pain Medicine:</strong><ul><li>To help with the pain, give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed.  </li><li>Reason: Helps back pain and muscle spasms. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Cold Pack:</strong><ul><li>For pain or swelling, use a cold pack. You can also use ice wrapped in a wet cloth.</li><li>Put it on the sore muscles for 20 minutes.</li><li>Repeat 4 times on the first day, then as needed.</li><li>Reason: Helps with the pain and muscle spasms.</li><li>Caution: Avoid frostbite.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Heat Pack:</strong><ul><li>If pain lasts over 2 days, put heat on the sore muscle.</li><li>Use a heat pack, heating pad or warm wet washcloth.</li><li>Do this for 10 minutes, then as needed. </li><li>Caution: Avoid burns.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Sleep:</strong><ul><li>Sleep on the side with a pillow between the knees. </li><li>If your child only sleeps on the back, put a pillow under the knees. </li><li>Avoid sleeping on the stomach. </li><li>The mattress should be firm. Do not sleep on a waterbed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Activity:</strong><ul><li>Avoid any sports or work that increase the pain. </li><li>Avoid lifting or jumping until well. </li><li>After 48 hours, start gentle back stretching exercises. </li><li>Complete bed rest is not needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Prevention of Backpack Pain:</strong><ul><li>Limit the weight of what is carried. It needs to less than 15% of body weight. That means a 100-pound child (45 kg) should not carry more than 15 pounds (7 kg).</li><li>A sign of carrying too much weight is having to lean forward when walking.</li><li>Buy a well-made backpack with wide, padded shoulder straps. Hip and chest straps help even out the weight of the pack.</li><li>Never carry the pack on just one shoulder. Reason: causes shoulder and neck pain.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>New back pain without a reason most often goes away in a few days.</li><li>Back pain from muscle overuse (strained back muscles) goes away in 1 to 2 weeks.</li></ul></div>\n",

(see bedbugregistry.com)</li><li>When you check into a hotel room, look for signs of bed bugs. Look for flecks of their waste (like coffee grounds) in the bedding and mattress. If present, ask for another room.</li><li>Keep your luggage and clothing on a luggage rack off the floor. </li><li>When you return from a trip, place all travel clothing into the clothes dryer. Run the dryer for 20 minutes. (Reason: The heat will kill any bed bugs or their eggs that are present). One pregnant bed bug can spread bed bugs to an entire house. </li></ul>\n",

The moisture sensor attaches to the underwear. It is triggered by just a few drops of urine. Most alarms turn on a loud sound that awakens your child. Another type awakens the child by vibrations. Some alarms do both.</li><li>Your child needs to operate the alarm by himself.</li><li>If you can't afford an enuresis alarm, consider using an alarm clock. Set it for three or four hours after he turns in.</li><li>Finally, your child needs to be motivated to solve this problem. Give him some ideas, but don't get over-involved.

In young children, most single problem behaviors will improve in 2 to 4 weeks with a targeted plan.</li><li>Behavior training (discipline techniques) gradually changes a self-centered toddler into a mature teen who is thoughtful and respectful of others, assertive without being aggressive, and in control of his or her impulses.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Structure the Home Environment:</strong> <ul><li>First deal with your child's safety by using gates on stairways and locks on screen doors.</li><li>Then deal with your toddler's normal need to explore. Put breakables out of reach. Hide valuables.</li><li>If needed, lock doors to rooms where you don't want your child poking around.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Teach Your Child any New Rule and Consequence in Advance:</strong><ul><li>Teach them when they are in a good mood and not busy. Tell them the rule and why it is important. </li><li>Tell them calmly what you will have to do if they break the rule. Then ask: &quot;Do you understand?&quot; After you get a &quot;yes&quot;, add; &quot;We will work on this together. I know you want to be better&quot;. </li><li>Then when they misbehave, you can ask: &quot;What is our rule about that?&quot;</li></ul></div><div><strong>Distract Your Child from Misbehavior:</strong><ul><li>Distracting a young child from temptation should often be tried first.</li><li>Distracting your child is especially helpful when the child is in someone else's home, a doctor's office, or a store. You may want to give a busy activity in advance if you're going to be on the phone or preparing a meal. Most young children can be distracted with toys or games. </li><li>School-age children are easier and may only need books.</li><li>TV or other video devices can serve as a last resort.</li><li>Distracting is also called redirecting a bored child.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Mean What You Say:</strong> <ul><li>Mean what you say and follow through. Be clear about what you want. Parents need to be in charge.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ignore the Misbehavior:</strong> <ul><li>Ignoring often helps unacceptable behavior that is harmless -- such as tantrums, sulking, whining, quarreling, or interrupting.</li><li>The proper way to ignore this misbehavior is to move away from your child, turn your back, and avoid eye contact. Stop any conversation with your child. Ignore any continued protests. Sometimes, you may need to leave the area where your child is misbehaving.</li><li>Ignoring is also called extinction.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Correct with Love: </strong><ul><li>Talk to your child the way you want people to talk to you. </li><li>Avoid yelling or using a disrespectful tone of voice. For example, say gently, &quot;I'm sorry you left the yard. Now you must stay in the house.&quot;</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give Verbal and Nonverbal Disapproval:</strong> <ul><li>Mild disapproval is often all that is required to stop a young child's misbehavior.</li><li>Move close to your child and get eye contact.  Look stern and give a brief, direct command, such as &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Stop.&quot; Speak in a disapproving but soft voice. You may want to underscore that you are serious by shaking your finger.</li><li>Also tell your child what you want him or her to do. The most common mistake parents make is talking too much (lecturing).</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give One Reminder of the Rule Before You Correct Your Child:</strong> <ul><li>Say &quot;Stop that or you will need a time-out&quot;.</li><li>When you know your child understands the rule, a reminder is not needed. You can give your consequence without a warning. This is especially important for hitting or other aggressive behavior.</li><li>Tell them what they did wrong while you are taking them to time-out.</li><li>Avoid threats (repeated reminder) of what are going to do if your child does not stop. Threats cause &quot;parent deafness&quot; and do not work.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Move or Escort Your Child to Where He Needs to Be:</strong><ul><li>Sometimes you will need to move your child from one place to another against his or her will. A common one is taking them to a time-out chair, if they won't go on their own. At other times, they must be taken to their bed, a bath, or the car if they refuse to go on their own. </li><li>Guide your child by the hand or forearm. </li><li>If your child refuses to be led, pick your child up from behind and carry him. This is also called &quot;manual guidance&quot;.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give the Consequence Now:</strong> <ul><li>Delayed consequences are less effective because young children forget why they are being punished. Consequences should happen very soon after the misbehavior. They should be given by the adult who saw the misdeed.</li><li>An exception may work for children older than 4 years who misbehave outside the home. You can put checkmarks on your child's hand with a felt-tip pen for each misbehavior to indicate the number of punishments the child will receive when you get home. The consequence might be 30 minutes of lost video time for each checkmark.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give a Temporary Time-Out: </strong><ul><li>Time-out removes the child from the scene of the unacceptable behavior to a boring place. Examples are to a corner, time-out chair, or bedroom. </li><li>Time-out is the most effective consequence available to parents for dealing with misbehaving toddlers and young children. </li><li>Time-outs should last about 1 minute per year of age and not more than 5 minutes. Remember, actions speak louder than words for young children. </li><li>See the Time-Out Technique handout for details.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Punish Your Child for Clear Intent of Aggression:</strong><ul><li>This mainly applies to aggressive children. Try to stop your child before someone is hurt or damage is done. An example would be that you see your child raising a toy to hit a playmate.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Let Natural Consequences Teach: </strong><ul><li>By experiencing the natural consequences of their own actions, your child can learn good behavior from the natural laws of the physical world. You can stand back and watch. Examples are: Coming to dinner late means the food will be cold; not dressing properly for the weather means your child will be cold or wet; running on ice can lead to falling down; putting sand in the mouth leads to an unpleasant taste; and breaking a toy means it isn't fun to play with anymore. </li><li>Although it is very helpful for children to learn from their mistakes, it is important that they not be allowed to do anything that could harm them or others, such as by playing with matches or running into the street.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Make a One-Sentence Comment About the Rule When You Correct Your Child:</strong> <ul><li>&quot;No hitting. We don't hurt people&quot;. That's all. </li><li>Avoid lecturing. Talking and explaining is not helpful for most young children.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Take Away a Possession or Privilege (Logical Consequences):</strong> <ul><li>Logical consequences are logically linked to the misbehavior. Most logical consequences are simply the temporary removal of a possession or privilege. Examples are: taking away toys or crayons that are not handled properly, not replacing a lost toy, not repairing a broken toy, sending your child to school partially dressed if the child won't dress himself, having your child clean up milk he has spilled, cleaning the floor your child has tracked mud on, and turning off the TV if children are fighting about it.</li><li>In addition, your child can temporarily lose TV, telephone, shopping, bicycle, and car privileges if they are misused.</li><li>The schoolteacher will provide appropriate logical consequences if your child does not complete homework assignments.</li><li>All of these help your child become more accountable for his mistakes and decisions.</li><li>Do not take away important privileges that build social skills. That would include going to a birthday party, soccer game or a scout troop meeting. Also, don't take away an event your child has looked forward to for a long time, such as a concert.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ignore Your Child's Arguments While You Are Correcting Your Child: </strong><ul><li>This is your child's attempt to delay the consequence. Young children understand action much more than words. Don't try to reason or argue with your child when they misbehave. They are not in a learning mode.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Delay a Privilege:</strong> <ul><li>This technique requires your child to finish a less desirable activity before allowing a more desirable one. It's the old reliable &quot;work before play&quot;. </li><li>Examples are: &quot;After you clean your room, you can go out and play&quot;; &quot;After you finish your homework, you can play video games&quot;; and &quot;After you taste all your foods, you can have dessert.&quot;</li></ul></div><div><strong>Make the Consequence Brief: </strong><ul><li>Time-outs should last no longer than 5 minutes. </li><li>Take toys out of circulation for no more than 1 day. </li><li>We want each day to start with a clean slate and an opportunity for your child to succeed. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Give an &quot;I&quot; Messages: </strong><ul><li>When your child misbehaves, tell your child how you feel. Say, &quot;I am upset when you do such and such.&quot; </li><li>Your child is more likely to listen and respond positively to you than if everything you say to your child starts with &quot;you.&quot; </li><li>&quot;You&quot; messages usually trigger a defensive reaction.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Follow the Consequence with Love and Trust:</strong> <ul><li>Welcome your child back into the family circle. Do not comment upon the previous misbehavior or require an apology for it.</li><li>Avoid degrading comments such as, &quot;You never do anything right&quot; or &quot;You're driving me crazy&quot;.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Negotiate with Your Older Child:</strong><ul><li>As children become older, they need more input into problem-solving. </li><li>A parent can begin such a conversation by saying, &quot;We need to change such and such. What are some ways we could handle this?&quot; </li><li>Discussions involving the whole family (family conferences) are helpful in the teen years.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Expect Behavior to Get Worse Before it Gets Better:</strong> <ul><li>Children who are out of control initially go through a phase of testing any new rules, before accepting them as law.</li><li>This testing usually lasts 3 days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>When Consequences Don't Seem to be Working, Try Love: </strong><ul><li>Assume he may have what I call: Affection Deficit Disorder (ADD). </li><li>Shower him with extra love and hugs when he is behaving. Love helps children want to listen to and please their parents. </li></ul></div>\n",

Examples are sharing toys, taking turns, being kind, doing chores, making the baby laugh, petting the dog gently, being a good sport, cleaning up, or reading a book.</li><li>Your child can also be praised for trying. Examples are trying to use the potty or attempting something difficult, like a puzzle.</li><li>Praise will make your child want to behave appropriately more often. Try to &quot;catch your child being good&quot;.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Write House Rules for the Most Important Kinds of Misbehavior: </strong><ul><li>For help, see the section titled <em>Rules: Guidelines for How to Create Them</em>.</li><li>Choose your rules (limits) carefully. They should be important and non-negotiable. </li></ul></div><div><strong>State the Acceptable and Desired Behavior: </strong><ul><li>Your child needs to know what is expected of him or her. Examples are: &quot;Play with your brother,&quot; &quot;Look at books when I'm on the telephone,&quot; or &quot;Walk, don't run.&quot; </li><li>When praising any good behavior, make it specific. For example, &quot;Thank you for being quiet.&quot;</li></ul></div><div><strong>Material Reinforcers for Good Behavior:</strong> <ul><li>Material reinforcers (incentives) are often candy, animal crackers, money, or video-time. </li><li>Incentives often need to be added to overcome resistance when children are entrenched in a power struggle around a &quot;no-win&quot; behavior. Examples are deliberately wetting or soiling their pants. </li><li>Incentives should be used for one problem behavior at a time and when praise alone has failed. </li><li>They should be phased out and replaced by natural (social) reinforcers as soon as possible.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Decide What Consequence You Will Use for Each Rule If Broken:</strong><ul><li>All behavior, good and bad, is mainly changed (or shaped) by consequences. If the consequence is pleasant (getting what they want or a reward), the child is more likely to repeat that behavior. If the consequence is unpleasant (negative feedback or a punishment), the child is less likely to do the same thing again.</li><li>Young children do not respond to lectures or reminders. Actions speak louder than words. The most effective actions are ignoring harmless misbehavior, redirecting the child to appropriate behavior, or giving your child a time-out.</li><li>For help, see the separate handoutm Behavior Training: Consequences.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ignore Harmless Misbehavior: </strong><ul><li>The more rules you have, the less likely your child will obey them. Constant criticism doesn't work. </li><li>Ignore unimportant behavior such as giving bad looks, not sitting still, poor table manners, backtalk, or interrupting people. These are near normal during the early years.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop Any Yelling: </strong><ul><li>Yelling teaches your child to yell back. Yelling matches also can escalate into a verbal battle (called playing &quot;uproar&quot;). We know the emotional brain turns on fast and the thinking brain takes a bit longer. So if you start to yell, try to stop until you gain control of your emotions. </li><li>Your child will respond better to a calm voice and an appropriate consequence. The adult has to downshift first.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Use Rules that are Fair and Attainable: </strong><ul><li>Rules must fit your child's age. </li><li>A child should not be punished for clumsiness when he or she is learning to walk. Same for poor enunciation when the child is learning to speak. In addition, a child should not be punished for behavior that is part of normal emotional development, such as thumb-sucking, fears of being separated from their parents, and toilet training accidents.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop Any Physical Punishment: </strong><ul><li>Most out-of-control children are already too aggressive. </li><li>Physical punishment (such as slapping the hand or spanking) teaches them that it's okay to be aggressive (such as hit or attack someone) to solve problems.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Concentrate on Two or Three Rules at the Start: </strong><ul><li>Give highest priority to issues of safety, such as not running into the street. </li><li>Next, address preventing harm to others. </li><li>Then, address behavior that damages property. </li><li>Only then go to all the annoying misbehaviors that wear you down.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Try to Avoid Public Places Until Misbehavior is Under Control at Home: </strong><ul><li>Misbehaving children are usually more difficult to control in a shopping mall or supermarket than at home. Leave your child with a sitter or partner when you need to go to these places.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Avoid Trying to Change &quot;No-Win&quot; Power Struggles Through More Pressure: </strong><ul><li>&quot;No-win behavior&quot; is behavior that usually cannot be controlled by the parent if the child decides to continue it. Examples are wetting pants, hair pulling, thumb sucking, body rocking, masturbation, not eating enough, not going to sleep, and refusal to complete schoolwork. </li><li>The first step in resolving such a power struggle is to withdraw from the conflict and stop punishing your child for the misbehavior. </li><li>Then switch to positive feedback and incentives, when he behaves as you'd like. </li><li>For help, see the section titled <em>Positive Feedback for Desired Behavior: Guidelines for How to Give</em>. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Try to Take Daily Breaks from Your Child: </strong><ul><li>Tell your partner when you need a break from supervising your young child. Ask then to take over all behavior training for a few hours. </li><li>If this is impossible, hire a teenager a few times a week to look after your child while you go out. </li><li>Also make a &quot;date&quot; for a weekly night out with your partner or a friend.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Apply Your Rules Consistently: </strong><ul><li>After parents agree on the rules, it's helpful to write them down. Then post them in a conspicuous place in the home to remind you of your game plan.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give Your Child More Positive Feedback:</strong> <ul><li>Children want to please and respond to discipline best when they feel loved. Every child needs lots of daily praise, smiles, and hugs. </li><li>Give your child this increased attention when he or she is not demanding it. Try hard to notice the times when your child is being good. If your child receives more negative criticism each day than positive responses, you need to restore a healthy emotional balance. It comes back to setting priorities. Have less rules, less criticism and more praise. Many experts feel that it takes 10 positive interactions to counter one negative interaction. </li><li>For help, see the section titled <em>Positive Feedback for Desired Behavior: Guidelines for How to Give.</em> </li></ul> </div><div><strong>Protect Your Child's Self-Esteem: </strong><ul><li>Remember that you are trying to change a bad behavior, but in a good child. Your child needs to know that he's a &quot;great kid&quot; and that you love him dearly. </li><li>Don't discuss your child's behavior problems with other people when your child is around. </li><li>Correct your child in a kind way. Sometimes begin your correction with &quot;I'm sorry I can't let you...&quot; </li><li>Don't label your child a &quot;bad boy.&quot; </li><li>After any punishment is over, welcome your child back into the family circle. Give him a clean slate.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Causes</strong></p><ul><li>Children usually discover biting by chance when they are about 1 year old and teething. Many children first learn to bite others by biting their parents in a playful manner. The biting will continue if the parents initially think it is cute and turn it into a game.</li><li>Later, children may bite when they are frustrated and want something from another child. For children with limited verbal skills, biting can become a primitive form of communication. After a child is 2 or 3 years old, biting can become a deliberate way to intimidate others and get their way.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Adult Reactions to Biting</strong></p><ul><li>Being attacked by a biter can be scary to a child.</li><li>The parent of the child who has been bitten is usually very upset. They may be worried about bad infections.</li><li>If biting happens in a child care setting, the other parents may want the biter to be expelled. If it happens in someone else's home, the child is often told never to return.</li><li>Adults tend to forget that some biting behavior in a group of toddlers is to be expected.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Biting</strong></p><ul><li>First, never give in to your child's demands because of biting.</li><li>The best time to stop biting behavior from becoming a habit is when the biting first starts.</li><li>Be sure that no one laughs when your child bites. Avoid any &quot;love-bites&quot; or nipping games. Reason: Your child will not understand how they are different from painful biting.</li><li>Make sure that child care providers understand your approach and are willing to follow it.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Clarify the Rule: &quot;No Biting&quot;: </strong><ul><li>Give your child a simple reason for the rule: &quot;Biting hurts. We do not hurt other people&quot;.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Interrupt Biting with a Sharp &quot;No&quot;: </strong><ul><li>When your child bites someone, intervene immediately. Be sure to use an unfriendly voice and look your child straight in the eye. You need to have zero tolerance for biting. </li><li>Sometimes if he looks as if he is going to bite someone, interrupt before he actually does it. Do not wait until the victim is hurt or screaming. </li><li>This is one behavior where punishment for intent may be needed. Close supervision of your child will be necessary until you are sure biting is no longer a risk.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give a Time-Out When He Bites Someone: </strong><ul><li>Send him to a boring place or corner.  Require one minute per year of age in time-out.</li><li>If time-out does not work, take away a favorite toy or all video time for the rest of the day. </li><li>If he tries to bite you while you are holding him, say &quot;No.&quot; Always put him down immediately and walk away (another form of time-out).</li></ul></div><div><strong>Never Bite Your Child for Biting Someone Else: </strong><ul><li>Biting back will make your child upset that you hurt him. It also teaches him that it is okay to bite if you are bigger. </li><li>Also do not wash your child's mouth out with soap. </li><li>Never pop his cheek or slap his mouth. It won't help and it might be reported as child abuse.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Teach Your Child Acceptable Ways to Get What He Wants: </strong><ul><li>Tell your child that if he wants something, he should come to you and ask for help. Teach your child to ask for what he wants rather than take it. </li><li>Teach him how to take turns. Teach him how to trade one of his toys to gain use of another child's toy.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Praise Your Child for Not Biting: </strong><ul><li>Before you embark on any high-risk visit with other children, remind your child gently not to bite. </li><li>Then if he doesn't bite, praise him afterward for being a &quot;good friend&quot;. Praise your child especially when he is in settings in which he used to bite. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Biting in Child Care Settings - Special Instructions:</strong><ul><li>Biting behavior is common in child care settings. This plan can be shared with child care staff to stop the behavior in their setting.</li><li>Provide close supervision and quickly place the biting child in time-out, even when he looks like he is going to bite someone.</li><li>Reassure the staff that while biting must be stopped, it is not medically harmful. Reason: Bites from baby teeth rarely break the skin.</li><li>Calling the parent at work is pointless. The problem should be dealt with immediately by the person who sees it.</li></ul></div>\n",

Shear forces separate the top layer of the skin from the lower layer. This forms a cushion (blister) of fluid over the spot of friction or pressure.</li><li>Hand blisters are often due to friction from using a tool too much. Examples are a shovel, pick, or rake. They can also be caused by sports equipment. Examples are a tennis racquet or boat oars. Gymnastics equipment (such as high bars) may also cause hand blisters.</li><li>Foot blisters are likely due to friction from an activity. Examples are hiking or running. Often, a child has new shoes or poorly-fitting shoes. Children starting a new sport may develop blisters. Also, a risk factor to forming blisters is recently increasing the activity time.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Foot Blisters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shoes.</strong> Buy shoes that fit. Do not wear shoes that are too tight or too loose. New hiking boots are often somewhat stiff. It is wise to first wear them around the house and on short walks.</li><li><strong>Socks.</strong> Do not use cotton socks. They tend to stay damp when wearing. Instead use synthetic (acrylic) or wool socks. Some people prefer to wear two socks at a time. You can wear a thin inner liner ('wicking') sock and a thicker outer sock.</li><li><strong>Lubricants.</strong> If your child often gets blisters at the same spot, use a lubricant. You can use petroleum jelly. Cover the area with a small amount of the lubricant before sports. This will help to reduce friction on the spot.</li><li><strong>Taping Pressure Points.</strong> If a lubricant doesn't stop blisters, taping is the next step. Taping is a very good way to treat hot spots for friction blisters. Many hikers and runners use taping. Use moleskin or duct tape. Cut a piece to a shape slightly larger than the pressure point. Put it on the pressure point. Smooth it from the center outward so that there are no wrinkles.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Hand Blisters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Gloves.</strong> Wear heavy-duty work gloves when working with the hands. Also, use gloves when working with tools. Examples are shovels, and rakes. Sports gloves can be used for rowing, paddling, weight lifting or cycling.</li><li><strong>Lubricants.</strong> Lower friction at pressure points by covering them with a lubricant. You can use petroleum jelly.</li></ul>\n",

Gently wiggle the needle to make the holes larger.</li><li>Remove the needle.</li><li>Press the fluid out through the holes.</li><li>Leave the roof of the blister in place to protect the raw skin underneath.</li><li>Use an antibiotic ointment.

      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Types of Formulas:</strong><ul><li>Milk-protein formulas, soy-protein formulas, and hydrolysate formulas</li><li>Soy formulas don't contain lactose or cow's milk protein. Currently, 20% of infants in the U.S. are fed soy formula. Often, switching to soy is not done with a valid reason.</li><li>Hydrolysate formulas mean the protein is broken down. These are advised when children are sensitive to both soy and milk protein.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Switching Formulas and Milk Allergies:</strong><ul><li>Switching from one milk-based formula to another is not helpful for any symptom. It is also not harmful.</li><li>Switching from milk formula to soy formula is sometimes helpful for severe diarrhea. This may occur from temporary low lactase levels. It may also be used for those families who are vegetarian.</li><li>Switching from milk formula to soy is sometimes helpful for cow's milk allergy. A cow's milk allergy occurs in 1-2% of infants. Most often, protein hydrolysate formulas (such as Alimentum or Pregestimil) are advised. This is because 15% of these infants are also allergic to soy protein.</li><li>Switching formulas for frequent crying, spitting up or gas is rarely helpful.</li><li>Don't switch formulas without talking with your child's doctor.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Powdered Versus Liquid Formulas:</strong><ul><li>Formulas come in 3 forms: powder, concentrated liquid and ready-to-feed liquid.</li><li>Concentrated formulas are mixed 1:1 with water.</li><li>Ready-to-feed formulas do not need any added water.</li><li>Powdered formulas are mixed 2 ounces (60 ml) of water per each level scoop of powder. Never add extra water because dilute formula can cause a seizure.</li><li>Powdered formula costs the least. Ready-to-feed formula costs the most.</li><li>Powdered formula is the easiest to use to supplement breastfeeding.</li><li>Ready-to-feed formula is the easiest to use for traveling.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Whole Cow's Milk, 1%, 2% and Skim Milk:</strong><ul><li>Cow's milk should not be given to babies before 12 months of age. Reason: Raises risk of iron deficiency anemia and allergies.</li><li>Skim milk (fat free milk), 1% low fat milk or 2% milk should not be used before 2 years. Reason: The fat content of whole cow's milk (3.5%) is required. It is needed for rapid brain growth.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Vitamins and Iron:</strong><ul><li>For all infants, use a formula that has iron in it. This helps to prevent iron deficiency anemia.</li><li>The iron amount in iron-fortified formulas is too small to cause any symptoms. Iron in formulas does not cause constipation or diarrhea.</li><li>Iron-fortified formulas contain all the vitamins and minerals needed.</li><li>Extra vitamins are therefore not needed for infants taking formula.</li><li>Fluoride: Babies don't need to take fluoride drops. Reason: The fluoride in toothpaste works very well. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Water to Mix With the Formula:</strong><ul><li>Most city water supplies are safe for making 1 bottle at a time. Run the cold tap water for 1 minute. Don't use warm tap water. (Reason: To avoid potential lead exposure). Heat cold water to desired temperature. Add this to powder or formula concentrate.</li><li>Exceptions:</li><li>Untested well water OR</li><li>City water with recent contamination OR</li><li>Your child has decreased immunity.</li><li>For these conditions, use distilled water, bottled water, or filtered tap water.</li><li>Another option is to use city water or well water that has been boiled. Boil for 10 minutes. Add 1 extra minute per each 1,000 feet (305 meters) of elevation.</li><li>Bottled water costs more than distilled water.</li><li>If making a batch of formula, distilled, bottled or boiled water is needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Extra Water:</strong><ul><li>Babies usually do not need extra water. (Reason: regular formula is 85% water)</li><li>Too much water can cause seizures.</li><li>You can offer some water if weather is very hot.</li><li>Don't give more than 4 ounces (120 ml) of extra water per day. Limit extra water during the first 6 months of life. Exception: Don't give any during the first month.</li><li>After starting solid foods, babies need more water.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Amounts - How Much Per Feeding:</strong><ul><li>The average amount of formula that babies take per feeding is:</li><li>Newborn: 2-3 ounces (60-90 ml) per feeding</li><li>1 month old: 4 ounces (120 ml) per feeding</li><li>2 months old: 5 ounces (150 ml) per feeding</li><li>4 months old: 6 ounces (180 ml) per feeding</li><li>6 months old: 7-8 ounces (210-240 ml) per feeding</li><li>The amount can vary depending on the baby's weight. It will also increase if the baby is going through a growth spurt. </li><li>A baby's appetite varies throughout the day. If the infant stops feeding or loses interest, that feeding can be stopped.</li><li>If healthy babies are less hungry at feedings, may need to increase the feeding interval.</li><li>The most amount of formula advised per day is 32 ounces (1 liter).</li><li>Over-feeding can cause vomiting, diarrhea or too much weight gain.</li><li>If your baby needs more than 32 ounces (1 liter) and is not overweight, start solids.</li><li>Get rid of any formula left in bottle at end of each feeding. Do not reuse this leftover formula. Reason: Contains germs that can grow.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Frequency Of Feedings (Schedules):</strong> Babies mainly need to be fed when they are hungry. If your baby is fussy and it's been more than 2 hours, feed him. Some guidelines are listed below:<ul><li>From birth to 3 months of age, feed every 2 to 3 hours.</li><li>From 3 to 9 months of age, feed every 3 to 4 hours.</li><li>Infants often set their own schedule by 1 to 2 months of age.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Length Of Feedings:</strong><ul><li>Feedings shouldn't take more than 20 minutes.</li><li>If the feeding is prolonged, check the nipple to be sure it isn't clogged.</li><li>A clean nipple should drip about 1 drop per second. Check this when the bottle of formula is turned upside down.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Night Feedings - How to Get Rid of Them:</strong><ul><li>Most newborns need to be fed at least twice each night.</li><li>Most formula-fed babies give up night feedings by 4 months of age. The tips below can help your baby sleep for longer stretches during the night:</li><li>Keep daytime feeding intervals to at least 2 hours. Slowly stretch them to 3 hours.</li><li>During daytime, your baby shouldn't sleep for more than 3 hours at a time. If your baby naps longer than that, wake him for a feeding.</li><li>Place your baby in the crib drowsy but awake. Don't bottle feed or rock until asleep.</li><li>Make middle-of-the-night feedings brief and boring compared to daytime feedings. Don't turn on the lights or talk to your child. Feed him rather quickly.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Formula Temperature:</strong><ul><li>Most babies like formula at body temperature.</li><li>In the summertime, some infants prefer formula that's cooler.</li><li>In the wintertime, some prefer warm formula.</li><li>The best temperature is the one your infant prefers. Either way, there's no health risk involved.</li><li>Just make sure the formula is not too hot. Reason: It can burn your baby's mouth.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Formula Storage:</strong><ul><li>If you can, make your child's formula fresh for each feed. However, if formula needs to be made ahead of time:</li><li>Prepared formula should be stored in the refrigerator. It must be used within 24 hours.</li><li>Open cans of formula should also be kept in the refrigerator. They should be covered and used within 24 hours.</li><li>Prepared formula left at room temperature for more than 1 hour should be discarded.</li><li>Leftover used formula should always be tossed. Reason: Contains germs that can grow.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Cereals and Other Solids:</strong><ul><li>Bottle-fed infants should be started on baby foods between 4 and 6 months. First baby foods can be cereals and/or fruit.</li><li>Starting before 4 months is not needed. Starting before 4 months makes feedings messier and longer. Early use of solids can also cause gagging.</li><li>Solids don't increase sleeping through the night for bottle-fed infants.</li><li>Delaying solids past 9 months of age is not advised. The delay runs the risk that your infant will refuse solids.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Burping:</strong><ul><li>It is not harmful if a baby doesn't burp.</li><li>Burping is an option, but not required.</li><li>It can decrease spitting up, but it doesn't lessen crying.</li><li>Burping can be done twice per feeding, once midway and once at the end.</li><li>If your baby does not burp after 1 minute of patting, it can be stopped.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Baby Bottle Tooth Decay:</strong><ul><li>Some older infants and toddlers are used to a bottle before sleeping.</li><li>Falling asleep with a bottle of milk or juice can cause severe tooth decay.</li><li>Prevent this bad habit by not using the bottle as a pacifier. Also, do not use the bottle as a security object.</li><li>If you cannot stop the bottles, fill it with water. Use water instead of formula or milk at bedtime.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Traveling:</strong><ul><li>Use bottles of ready-to-feed formula (most expensive).</li><li>Or mix formula ahead of travel and carry in a cold insulated container.</li><li>Or use powered formula. Put the required number of scoops in a bottle. Carry clean water in a separate bottle. Mix before each feeding.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Nipples and Bottles:</strong><ul><li>Any nipple/bottle products are fine.</li><li>It is not necessary to sterilize bottles or nipples. Wash them with soap and water. Rinse them thoroughly.</li><li>It is also safe to wash bottles and nipples in the dishwasher.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Formula-fed Stools, Normal:</strong><ul><li><strong>Meconium Stools</strong> are dark greenish-black, thick and sticky. They normally are passed during the first 3 days of life.</li><li><strong>Transitional Stools</strong> are a mix of meconium and milk stools. They are greenish-brown and more loose. They are passed day 4 to 5 of life.</li><li><strong>Normal Milk Stools</strong> without any meconium are seen from day 6 on.</li><li>Formula-fed babies pass 1 to 8 stools per day during the first week. Then it starts to slow down to 1 to 4 per day. This lasts until 2 months of age.</li><li>The stools are yellow in color and thick like peanut butter. Green stools are also normal (usually caused by bile).</li><li>After 2 months of age, most babies pass 1 or 2 stools per day. The can also pass 1 every other day. They are soft and solid.</li><li>Some pushing or straining with stools is normal at any age. Babies under 6 months also normally grunt, become flushed, and draw up legs. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal Urination in Formula-fed Infants: </strong><ul><li>Urine production increases quickly in formula fed babies. The number of wet diapers per day depends on how much formula the baby consumes.</li><li>Day of life (DOL) 1 at least 2 wet diapers; DOL 2 at least 4 wet diapers. </li><li>By DOL 3, your baby should have 6 or more wet diapers/day. (passing urine every 3-4 hours)</li><li>From 1 week to 12 months of age, babies normally pass urine every 2 - 4 hours. Frequency depends on the amount of formula consumed. </li><li>Wet diapers can normally decrease during warm weather or if the home is warm. Lack of urination is not abnormal until 8 hours have passed without any urine. </li><li>Super absorbent diapers can make it difficult to tell if your child has passed urine. To count a diaper as being wet, it should feel much heavier than a dry diaper. Another tip for detecting urine passage is to place a tissue or cotton ball in the diaper. </li><li>Note: Some diapers have a line on them that changes color when your baby passes.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Breast Discomfort In Bottle-feeding Mothers:</strong><ul><li>Even though you chose not to breastfeed, your breasts will make milk. Breastmilk comes in on day 2 or 3. Swollen breasts can be painful for a few days. Here is what to do:</li><li><strong>Ibuprofen</strong>. Take 400 mg of ibuprofen 3 times per day. This will help to lessen pain and swelling. There's no special prescription medicine for this.</li><li><strong>Ice.</strong> Use a cold pack or ice bag wrapped in a wet cloth. Put it on your breasts for 20 minutes. Do this as often as needed. This will decrease milk production. Do not use heat. Heat will increase milk production.</li><li><strong>Pumping.</strong> For moderate pain, hand express or pump off a little breastmilk. This will help to reduce your pain. Pumping breastmilk can increase milk production. But, doing this to take the edge off your discomfort is not harmful.</li><li><strong>Bra. </strong>Wear a bra that offers good breast support or a sports bra. Wear it 24 hours a day.</li><li><strong>Binding.</strong> Binding the breasts by wearing a tight bra is no longer advised. Binding by using an elastic wrap is also not advised. Binding can increase the risk of breast infections (mastitis).</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Signs of a Good Milk Supply:</strong> (Is your baby getting enough breast milk?)<ul><li>It is very important that your baby is latched on right. This way she can get enough milk.</li><li>Wait for your baby's mouth to open wide. Then have your baby take nipple and part of areola. Lips must be wide open (like a fish) to get a good latch. Sometimes it helps to push down on the chin.</li><li>Look and listen for regular swallowing. This shows that your milk has letdown. Letdown is the release of breastmilk into the milk ducts just before a feeding. It starts after 2 to 3 weeks of nursing. At first, milk letdown may take 60 to 90 seconds of sucking before it starts.</li><li>As your milk volume increases and is established (usually by day 4 of life), you should see the following:</li><li><strong>Stools:</strong> The number of stools passed is the best sign of how much breast milk is being taken. See that section for details.</li><li><strong>Urine</strong>: Expect a steady increase in the number of wet diapers for each day of life. Three wet diapers per day can be normal while milk is coming in. By day 5 of life, your baby should have 6 or more wet diapers per day. Note: If you aren't sure about the diaper being wet, place a tissue in the diaper.</li><li>Caution: Once the milk is in, infrequent stools are not normal for the first month of life. However, it can become normal after 4 weeks of age.</li><li>Your baby should be satisfied (not hungry) after feedings.</li><li>Your breasts should feel full before feedings and soft after feedings.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Breastfed Stools During the First Weeks of Life</strong>:<ul><li><strong>Meconium Stools</strong> are dark greenish-black, thick and sticky. They are passed during the first 2 days of life.</li><li><strong>Transitional Stools</strong> (a mix of meconium and milk stools) are greenish-brown and loose. They are passed day 3 to 4 of life. While breastmilk is coming in, babies have about one stool per day. This is usually from day 1 to 4. By day 5, passing black or dark green stools is not normal. Your baby should be seen to make sure your baby is getting enough milk.</li><li><strong>Normal Breastmilk Stools</strong> without any meconium present are seen from day 5 on. The stools are runny, mustard-colored and can contain seedy particles. Normal breastfed stools can also be green. The green color is from bile. Runny stools can even be bordered by a water ring. This is normal, especially during the first month. (Reason: rapid transit.)</li><li>Normal stool size is about half to 1 tablespoon (8 to 15 ml).</li><li>If breastfed babies get any formula, their stools become greener. They also become more frequent, more formed and odorous.</li><li><strong>Number of Stools</strong>. The number of stools is the best marker for how much breastmilk the baby is getting. On day 2 and 3, the baby should pass 1 or 2 stools per day. By day 4 or 5, the baby should be passing 3 or more normal breastmilk stools per day. Once breastfeeding is established, babies normally pass 4 stools per day to 1 after each feeding during the first month of life.</li><li>Breastfed stools have changed to <strong>true diarrhea</strong> if:</li><li>There is a sudden increase in the number of stools</li><li>They have any blood or lots of mucus</li><li>Smell bad </li><li>Your baby feeds poorly, acts sick, or a fever occurs</li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal Infrequent Breastfed Stools After 1 Month of Age:</strong><ul><li>Between 4 and 8 weeks of age, some breastfed babies change to normal infrequent stools.</li><li>They can pass 1 large soft stool every 4 to 7 days.</li><li>Reason: Complete absorption of breastmilk.</li><li>The longer they go without a stool, the larger the volume that is passed.</li><li>There is no pain or crying with stool passage.</li><li>Some pushing or straining with stools is normal at any age. Babies under 6 months also normally grunt, become flushed, and draw up legs.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal Urination in Breastfed Infants:</strong><ul><li>During the first week of life, expect a steady increase in the number of wet diapers per day. It depends on when the full milk supply comes in.</li><li>Day of life (DOL) 1 at least 1 wet diaper, DOL 2 at least 2 wet diapers, DOL 3 at least 3 wet diapers. </li><li>By DOL 5, your baby should have 6 or more wet diapers/day. (passing urine every 4 hours). </li><li>From 1 week to 12 months of age, babies normally pass urine every 2 - 4 hours. Frequency depends on the amount of milk consumed. </li><li>Wet diapers can normally decrease during warm weather or if the home is warm. Lack of urination is not abnormal until 8 hours have passed without any urine. </li><li>Super absorbent diapers can make it difficult to tell if your child has passed urine. To count a diaper as being wet, it should feel much heavier than a dry diaper. Another tip for detecting urine passage is to place a tissue or cotton ball in the diaper. </li><li>Note: Some diapers have a line on them that changes color when your baby passes urine.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Milk Letdown that Causes Pulling Away, Coughing or Choking:</strong><ul><li>Sometimes, a milk surge will be more than your baby can keep up with.</li><li>Your baby's reaction will be to pull away from the breast. She may cry, cough or even choke.</li><li>Stop the feeding and let your baby recover.</li><li>Wait until the letdown spray stops before putting her back to the breast.</li><li>Pausing and burping more often may help.</li><li>Prevention: The overactive letdown often occurs in mothers who pump often. So, finish one side all the way. Then only pump the other side enough to get rid of any pain.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Burping:</strong><ul><li>You do not have to burp your baby. Burping is an option, but not needed.</li><li>It is not harmful if a baby doesn't burp.</li><li>Burping can lessen spitting up, but it doesn't decrease crying.</li><li>Burping can be done twice per feeding, once midway and once at the end.</li><li>If the baby does not burp after 1 minute of patting, it can be stopped.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Vitamin D for the Baby:</strong><ul><li>Breast milk contains all the needed vitamins and minerals except Vitamin D.</li><li><strong>Vitamin D.</strong> Starting the first week of life, all breastfed babies need Vitamin D. The dose is 400 IU per day. (AAP Committee on Nutrition 2009). You can use separate Vitamin D drops. Some preparations contain 400 IU of Vitamin D in only one drop. D-Vi-Sol are liquid vitamin D drops that have 400 IU per 1 ml. Or, you can use Vitamin ADC drops in a dose of 1 ml per day. (No prescription is needed).</li><li>Your child needs Vitamin D drops until he drinks enough cow's milk or formula. This is at least 32 ounces (1000 ml) of milk or formula per day. Each 8 ounces (250 ml) contains 100 IU of Vitamin D.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Sick Infants:</strong><ul><li>Do not stop breastfeeding for vomiting, spitting up, diarrhea, cough, or jaundice.</li><li>Keep breastfeeding when possible. Offer pumped breastmilk in a bottle if baby is not able to nurse. </li><li>Talk with your doctor or nurse to decide if your baby needs to be seen.</li></ul></div>\n",

Limit the use of the pacifier.</li><li>Pump the breasts for 10 minutes after each feeding. Do this only for a few days (see lactation consultant as this is tiring). Electric breast pumps that are double-sided give the best results.</li><li>Mother-baby skin-to-skin contact may also help increase the milk supply.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Supplemental Bottle Feedings:</strong><ul><li>You should be nursing your baby every 2 hours (start to start) for the first week after birth. Reason: to get the colostrum and to establish a good milk supply.</li><li>In general, don't offer your baby any bottles of formula before 3 to 4 weeks old. Reason: It will interfere with creating a good milk supply.</li><li>There are some exceptions. Medical indications to prevent dehydration or severe jaundice include the following:</li><li>The milk is not in (day 2 - 4) AND your baby is very hungry (especially preterms)</li><li>Not enough wet or poopy diapers OR</li><li>Your baby is quite jaundiced. Reason: Prevents dehydration.</li><li>After every breastfeeding for 1 or 2 days, give expressed breastmilk or formula. Give 1 ounce (30 ml) at a time. Some babies may only take ½ ounce (15 ml).</li><li>See your child's doctor within 24 hours for a weight check and a feeding assessment. Reason: More than 2 formula feedings in 24 hours can lead to a decrease in milk production.</li><li>Triple feedings (nursing, pumping and bottle feeding) are tiring. A lactation specialist can help. Call your local hospital for a referral.</li><li>Gradually stop the supplements as your milk supply increases.</li><li><strong>Call Your Doctor If:</strong></li><li>You think your baby needs an extra bottle feeding</li></ul></div><div><strong>When to Introduce a Bottle:</strong><ul><li>When your baby is 4 weeks old, if your baby is nursing well, offer a bottle. Use pumped breastmilk or 1 ounce (30 ml) of formula. This allows him to get used to a bottle and the nipple.</li><li>Frequency: Start with a bottle feeding once per day. After your baby accepts bottle feedings, continue them once every 3 days or so. This insures that he will continue to accept them.</li><li>If you wait too long (such as 8 weeks), some babies will reject bottle feedings.</li><li>Bottle acceptance allows you to leave your baby with a sitter or other family member. It's also essential if you plan on going back to work outside the home.</li><li>You can use pumped breast milk that has been refrigerated or frozen or formula.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Extra Water Not Needed:</strong><ul><li>Never give extra water to infants younger than 6 months. Reason: Too much water can cause a seizure.</li><li>It's not needed. (Reason: Breast milk contains 88% water.)</li><li>If your baby gets enough breast milk, extra fluids are not needed. They may decrease your baby's interest and ability to breastfeed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Cereals and Other Solid Foods:</strong> <ul><li>Breast-fed infants should be started on baby foods at 6 months. First baby foods can be cereals and/or fruit.</li><li>Starting before 6 months is not needed. Starting before 6 months makes feedings messier and longer. Early use of solids can also cause gagging.</li><li>Solids don't increase sleeping through the night for breast-fed infants.</li><li>Caution: Delaying solids past 9 months of age is not advised. The delay runs the risk that your infant will refuse solids.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Storage of Breast Milk:</strong><ul><li>Freshly pumped breast milk can be stored for 5 days in a refrigerator.</li><li>Frozen breast milk can be kept 6 months in a refrigerator freezer. Put the milk inside the freezer, not on side shelves. It can be kept 12 months in a deep freezer. If your ice cream is solidly frozen, the temperature is fine.</li><li>To thaw frozen milk, put the bag of breast milk in the refrigerator. It will take a few hours to thaw.</li><li>For quicker thawing, place it in a pan of warm water. Do this until it has warmed up to the temperature your baby likes. Never warm it up in a microwave or boiling water. This would destroy the antibodies that protect your baby from getting sick.</li><li>After thawing, breast milk can be kept safely in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Do not refreeze. After feeding your baby, toss any unused breast milk in a bottle after 1 hour.</li></ul></div>\n",

Do not use pacifiers.</li><li>Remove a little milk before feeding your baby. Hand express or briefly use a breast pump.</li><li>Gently squeeze the areola with your fingers at the start of each feeding. This will soften the areola and help your baby latch on. Milk release won't occur if your baby only latches on to the nipple.</li><li>Pump your breasts when they hurt or when a feeding doesn't help discomfort. Also, pump when you must miss a feeding.</li><li>Use a cold pack on the breasts between feedings. Cold, clean raw cabbage leaves or a bag of frozen peas work well.</li><li><strong>Call Your Doctor or Lactation Consultant if:</strong></li><li>Not better after 24 hours of this treatment.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Blocked Milk Ducts (Tender lump in the breast):</strong><ul><li>Causes the breast not being emptied all the way</li><li>Treatment goal: Open up the blocked milk ducts</li><li>Breastfeed your baby more often. Do not use pacifiers.</li><li>Before each feeding session, use heat on the breast lump for 5 minutes. Do this with a hot shower, hot bath or heating pad.</li><li>While feeding or pumping, massage the swollen areas toward the nipple.</li><li>Try different feeding positions at the breast. A different position may drain the affected area (ducts) better.</li><li><strong>Call Your Doctor If:</strong></li><li>Lump becomes red and very painful</li><li>Fever occurs</li><li>Not better after 24 hours of treatment</li></ul></div><div><strong>Sore or Cracked Nipples:</strong><ul><li>Most often, due to friction from not latching on right. Can also be due to a non-areolar grasp on the breast.</li><li>Clean with warm water once daily. Do not use soap which dries out the skin.</li><li>For sore nipples, coat and lubricate nipple and areola with breast milk.</li><li>For cracked nipples, use 100% lanolin after feedings. No prescription is needed. (Exception: mother allergic to wool). Hydrogel pads are also good for healing.</li><li>Help your baby latch on to as much of the areola as possible. Do this by compressing the areola. (Proper latching-on should prevent nipple injury)</li><li>Prevent the breast from pulling out of your baby's mouth. Support the breast from below during feedings.</li><li>Start feedings on the side that is least sore.</li><li>Limit feedings to less than 10 minutes on the sore side. Total feeding should not last more than 30 minutes.</li><li>Your baby should be kept on task and awake during feeds. Sometimes, they flutter feed while almost asleep and won't actively suck. This can lead to sore nipples.</li><li>Don't pull your baby off the nipple until she has released her grip. You can break the seal by placing your finger in the mouth between gums.</li><li><strong>Call Your Doctor If: </strong></li><li>Not better after 24 hours of treatment</li></ul></div><div><strong>Leaking Breast Milk:</strong><ul><li>Leaking milk is a common problem that nursing mothers have during the first months.</li><li>Usually, the leaking lessens as supply starts to equal demand. A balance is made between what the baby drinks and what the breasts make. Here's what you can do:</li><li>Keep a regular nursing pattern. Try to not skip or postpone feedings. (Reason: More milk leaks from over-full breast.)</li><li>Use nursing pads under your bra. You can use pads that can be thrown away or washable pads. Change pads often to keep your nipples dry.</li><li>Shirts with patterns hide milk spots better.</li><li>You can also carry a clean top in your diaper bag when you go out.</li><li>If this advice doesn't help, ask a lactation consultant for more tips.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Foods for the Nursing Mom:</strong><ul><li><strong>Foods.</strong> Eat a diet that is varied and balanced. Choose foods that are fresh if you can. There is no specific diet that increases milk supply. Most foods are well tolerated if eaten in moderation. The effect on the baby of foods in the mother's diet (including chocolate) is overrated. Foods eaten while pregnant are most often well tolerated by the breastfed infant.</li><li><strong>Gassy Foods.</strong> Foods such as cabbage, broccoli, or beans produce gas in some people. If you feel gassy after eating them, your baby might, too. It should just last a short time. It also doesn't mean you need to stop eating them.</li><li><strong>Honey.</strong> Honey is safe for nursing moms to eat or to use for a cough. Botulism isn't passed through breast milk. So, honey is safe for moms no matter the age of the baby.</li><li><strong>Vitamins.</strong> Keep taking your prenatal vitamins while you breastfeed.</li><li>Making milk burns 500 calories per day. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Fish and Mercury:</strong><ul><li>Certain types of fish have higher levels of mercury. These should not be eaten while nursing. Reason: risk of mercury toxicity that can affect your baby.</li><li>Fish to avoid: shark, swordfish, king mackerel or tilefish. See www.fda.gov for full list.</li><li>Common safe fish choices are salmon, shrimp, pollock, tilapia, cod, catfish and canned light tuna.</li><li>Limit white (albacore) tuna and tuna steaks to one serving (6 ounces) a week.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Caffeine - Avoid Too Much:</strong><ul><li>Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, energy drinks and soft drinks. Too much caffeine can cause restlessness, crying, even diarrhea in your baby.</li><li>Limit caffeine drinks to two 8 ounces (480 mL) servings per day. (Max: 300 mg per day).</li><li>The average cup of coffee contains about 150 mg of caffeine.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Herbs - Use with Caution:</strong><ul><li>Herbs are sometimes suggested to help increase milk supply. But, there is a lack of research that support that they actually work.</li><li>Ask your child's doctor before you use herbal products.</li><li>The quality of herbal products isn't regulated which can pose a safety risk.</li><li>They can interact with other needed drugs and cause side effects.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Alcohol Use:</strong><ul><li><strong>One Drink. </strong>An occasional glass of wine, a beer or a cocktail is safe. Limit alcohol to no more than 1 drink per day. Nurse your baby before you drink and wait at least 2 hours before nursing again. If you feel affected by the drink, pump and dump the milk. </li><li><strong>More than 1 Drink in 2 Hours.</strong> If you have more than 1 drink, you should pump and dump your milk. Do this for at least 8 hours or until you no longer feel affected by the alcohol. When the alcohol is cleared from your blood, it's also cleared from your milk.</li><li>Too much alcohol can be harmful. It can cause drowsiness, interfere with your baby's motor development and affect your milk letdown.</li><li>Drinking beer does not increase the milk supply.</li></ul></div>\n",

Reason: It will be out of your system by the next feeding.</li><li>Most common drugs are safe. These include Tylenol, Motrin or Advil, stool softeners, and cough drops (including honey). Nose sprays, eye drops, and skin creams are also safe.</li><li><strong>Pain or Fever:</strong> Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) and ibuprofen (such as Advil) are safe. Aspirin should be avoided. (Reason: risk for bleeding or Reye syndrome). Baby aspirin (81 mg) once daily for mothers with special medical issues is safe.</li><li><strong>Decongestants (like Sudafed):</strong> Do not use these meds. They can reduce milk supply in some mothers.</li><li><strong>Nose Sprays:</strong> Nose sprays can be used. A decongestant spray (such as Afrin) is a safe choice while nursing. Do not use for more than 3 days. A steroid nose spray can also be used for a longer time. Saline nose sprays are safe to use as needed for stuffy noses.</li><li><strong>Allergy Meds:</strong> These drugs for allergy symptoms are OK during breastfeeding. Non-sedating allergy meds (long-acting ones such as Claritin) are preferred. They can be given as needed once per day at bedtime. Do not use combination products with decongestants.</li><li><strong>Cough Meds:</strong> Dextromethorphan (DM) is okay to use while nursing. Breastfed babies should be watched for sleepiness or poor feeding. Cough drops and honey are safe to use by moms for a cough. (Caution: Do not give honey to infants less than 1 year old).</li><li>Talk with your doctor or nurse about other medicines before using.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Herbs - Use with Caution:</strong><ul><li>Herbs are sometimes suggested to help increase milk supply. But, there is a lack of research that support that they actually work.</li><li>Ask your child's doctor before you use herbal products.</li><li>The quality of herbal products isn't regulated which can pose a safety risk.</li><li>They can interact with other needed drugs and cause side effects.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Prescription Medicines That Are Safe to Use While Breastfeeding:</strong><ul><li>It's best to take your medicine(s) at the end of a feeding. Reason: It will be out of your system by the next feeding.</li><li>Some common safe prescription drugs are penicillin, erythromycin, cephalosporins, or antiviral medicines. Stool softeners, nosedrops, eyedrops, and skin creams are also safe.</li><li>Don't use sulfa drugs like Septra and Bactrim until baby is 4 weeks old.</li><li><strong>Hydrocodone and oxycodone.</strong> Lower doses (5 mg) taken occasionally are generally safe to use after surgery. Higher doses (10 mg) and frequent/prolonged use may lead to a sleepy baby. Watch your baby closely. Switch to Motrin or Tylenol when pain lessens and as soon as you can.</li><li><strong>Pain medicines used in surgery.</strong> The gas that you breathe in during surgery (general anesthesia) clears quickly from your body. Milk levels are low. It is safe to breastfeed once you are alert enough.</li><li>Talk with your doctor or nurse about other medicines before using.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Internet Resources for Mother's Meds and Breastfeeding:</strong><ul><li>For all other drugs, call your doctor or use one of these resources.</li><li><strong>LactMed </strong>is a drug/lactation website. It gives info on the safety of medicines while nursing. It's on TOXNET at http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov. TOXNET is the toxicology data website of the National Library of Medicine.</li><li><strong>Infant Risk Call Center.</strong> Provides current information on the use of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Organized by Dr. Tom Hale at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. They answer calls Monday-Friday 8 am - 5 pm central time. (806)-352-2519. Website at www.infantrisk.com.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Vaccines:</strong><ul><li>All vaccines are safe for a mother to get if she is nursing.</li><li>Live vaccines (such as MMR) are not given to women who are pregnant.</li><li>Check the CDC website (www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding) for more info.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Marijuana or Other Drug Use:</strong><ul><li><strong>Marijuana.</strong> Marijuana use by nursing mothers is strongly discouraged. It is found in breastmilk at an 8 times higher level than in blood. It is not known how long marijuana lasts in breastmilk. It is known that it is stored in fatty tissues for a long time. Early exposure may cause long-term changes in your child's behavior and development.</li><li><strong>Other Illegal Drugs.</strong> Nursing mothers should avoid all illegal mind-altering drugs. Drugs like heroin are found in the milk at high levels. They are passed quickly on to the baby. Exposure can be harmful to your baby. Breastfeeding should be stopped in cases of chronic substance abuse.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Maternal Smoking or Tobacco:</strong><ul><li>It is best to not use tobacco. But, the benefit of nursing your baby generally outweighs the risks of smoking.</li><li>Nicotine passes into the milk. It may cause restlessness, increased heart rate, and loose stools. Heavy tobacco use (over 1/2 pack per day) can decrease your milk supply. It can also affect milk letdown.</li><li>If you smoke, do not smoke around your baby.</li><li>Feed your baby before you smoke. Hold off on feeding your baby after you smoke as long as you can.</li><li>Talk to your doctor about starting a smoking cessation program.</li><li>Products like nicotine gum or a patch are better for your baby than smoking.</li><li>If you can't quit, cut back on the number of cigarettes you smoke daily.</li><li>If you must smoke, use low-nicotine cigarettes.</li></ul></div>\n",

Examples are apple juice and lemonade. </li><li>Amount. If 3 - 12 months of age, give 1 ounce (30 ml) each time. Limit to 4 times per day.

Instead, treat the cough using the these tips:</li><li>AGE 3 months to 1 year: Give warm clear fluids to treat the cough. Examples are apple juice and lemonade. Amount: Use a dose of 1-3 teaspoons (5-15 ml). Give 4 times per day when coughing. Caution: Do not use honey until 1 year old.</li><li>AGE 1 year and older: Use HONEY ½ to 1 teaspoon (2-5 ml) as needed. It works as a homemade cough medicine.

If you don't have saline, you can use a few drops of bottled water or clean tap water. (If under 1 year old, use bottled water or boiled tap water.)</li><li>STEP 1: Put 3 drops in each nostril.

Then, do the other side.</li><li>STEP 3: Repeat nose drops and suctioning until the discharge is clear.</li><li>How often: Do nasal saline when your child can't breathe through the nose. Limit: No more than 4 times per day.</li><li>Saline nose drops or spray can be bought in any drugstore. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Other option: use a warm shower to loosen mucus. Breathe in the moist air, then suction.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Humidifier:</strong><ul><li>If the air in your home is dry, use a humidifier.

It's also called normal fussy crying. It usually occurs at times when your baby is sleepy.</li><li>It has nothing to do with your parenting.</li><li>It is not caused by gas, spitting up or stomach pain.</li><li>Gas does not cause crying. All crying babies pass lots of gas. Their stomachs also make lots of gassy noises. The gas comes from swallowed air. The gas is normal. It does not cause any pains.</li><li>Feeding too much.

Limit your coffee, tea and energy drinks to 2 servings per day. That's 2 cups or 16 ounces (480 ml).</li></ul></div><div><strong>Hold and Comfort for Crying:</strong><ul><li>Hold and try to calm your baby whenever he cries without a reason. Hold your baby flat to help them relax and go to sleep.</li><li>Rock your child in a rocking chair, in a cradle or while standing. Many babies calm best with rapid tiny movements like vibrations.</li><li>Place in an infant swing or vibrating chair.</li><li>Take for a stroller ride, outdoors or indoors.</li><li>Do anything else you think may be comforting. Examples are using a pacifier, massage, or warm bath.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Swaddle your Baby in a Blanket for Crying:</strong><ul><li>Swaddling is the most helpful technique for calming crying babies. It also keeps your baby from waking up with a startle reflex.</li><li>Use a big square blanket and the &quot;burrito-wrap&quot; technique:</li><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Have the arms inside and straight at the sides.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pull the left side of the blanket over the upper body and tuck.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Fold the bottom up with the knees a little flexed.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pull the right side over the upper body and tuck.</li><li>Caution: Don't cover your baby's head or overheat your baby.</li><li>Caution: Stop swaddling when your baby shows any signs of rolling over. Age limit: 2 months. The startle reflex will usually be gone by this age. At 2 months, it's time to transfer to a sleep sack with the arms out.</li><li>Read the book (or view the DVD),&quot;The Happiest Baby on the Block&quot;. Both products are authored by Dr. Harvey Karp. It is a good resource on how to calm fussy babies.</li></ul></div><div><strong>White Noise for Crying:</strong><ul><li>Swaddling works even better when paired with a low-pitched white noise. Examples are a white noise CD for babies, nature sounds CD, vacuum cleaner or fan.</li><li>Caution: Avoid making white noise too loud. Reason: could damage hearing.</li><li>Keep the white noise on any time your baby is crying.</li><li>When your baby is awake and not crying, keep your baby unwrapped. Turn off the white noise. Reason: So she can get used to the normal sounds of your home.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Falling Asleep on Their Own:</strong><ul><li>Often, babies cry because they need to sleep. If over 2 hours have passed since the last nap, this could be the reason.</li><li>You have tried different ways to comfort your baby. You fed him recently. Nothing you do seems to help your baby relax. If so, it's time to get out of the way.</li><li>Swaddle your baby. Place him on his back in his crib. Turn on some white noise or soothing music and leave the room.</li><li>Let your baby fuss until he falls asleep.</li><li>For some overtired babies, this is the only answer.</li><li>Try to prevent an overtired baby.

You can use juice, water, Gatorade or even soda.</li><li>Goal: Passing large chunks of stool, either before or after the enema.</li><li>Caution: Stay home and near a toilet. Your child will have diarrhea and could have a massive blowout. If your child isn't toilet trained, keep him in a pull-up.</li><li>Diet: Keep your child on a regular diet.</li><li>Fluids: Encourage lots of extra fluids.

This is usually at the end of the 2nd day on Miralax.</li><li>Repeat an enema once daily for  days. This is usually for 3 straight days.</li><li>Caution: Enemas are generally not used under 2 years of age.</li><li><strong>Suppositories.</strong> For some children, a glycerin suppository can be used instead of an enema. It also will help to release the soft stools.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Enema Dosage:</strong><ul><li>Caution: Saline (Phosphate) enemas can cause complications if too much is given. The dosage of enemas must be accurate, based on your child's weight.</li><li>Dosage: 1 ounce for every 20 pounds of your child's weight.

Sometimes, enemas can cause dehydration.</li><li>Have your child lie on his stomach. His knees should be pulled up and under him.</li><li>Enemas come in a disposable squeeze bag with a soft-tipped nozzle. Lubricate the enema nozzle and gently put it 1 1/2 inches to 2 inches into the rectum.</li><li>Gradually squeeze the contents of the container into the rectum.</li><li>When the right amount is given, remove the tube.</li><li>Your child should wait to sit on the toilet until he feels a strong need to have a bowel movement. Usually, this takes 2 to 10 minutes. Encourage your child to hold back the enema for 5 minutes.</li><li>For children who aren't toilet trained, give the enema in the bathroom. Also, try to put the child on the toilet after a few minutes. If he resists, just put him in a diaper or pull-up.

This is from irritation of the airway, not an allergic reaction.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention - How to Reduce the Pollen Your Child Breathes</strong></p><ul><li>Pollen is carried in the air.</li><li>Keep windows closed in the home, at least in your child's bedroom.</li><li>Keep windows closed in car.

No prescription is needed. They need to be given every 6 to 8 hours.</li><li>The key to control is to give allergy meds every day during pollen season.</li><li>Regular cough medicines are not helpful for allergic coughs.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Allergy Medicines Long-Acting:</strong><ul><li>Cetirizine (Zyrtec) and Loratadine (Claritin) are long-acting allergy medicines.

They are long-acting and last up to 24 hours.</li><li>AGE 2- 5 years old, give 2.5 mg (2.5 ml or 1/2 teaspoon) of liquid syrup. Use once daily in the morning.</li><li>AGE 6-11 years old, give 5 mg chewable tablet once daily in morning.</li><li>AGE 12 years and older, give 10 mg tablet once daily in morning.</li><li>Downside: Doesn't control allergy symptoms as well as older allergy medicines. Also, sometimes will have breakthrough symptoms before 24 hours. If that happens, you can give a single dose of Benadryl or CTM.</li><li>Cost: Ask the pharmacist for a store brand. Reason: Costs less than the brand names.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Homemade Cough Medicine:</strong><ul><li>Goal: Decrease the irritation or tickle in the throat that causes a dry cough. These treatments can be used along with the allergy medicines.</li><li>AGE 1 year and older: Use HONEY ½ to 1 teaspoon (2-5 ml) as needed. It works as a homemade cough medicine. It can thin the secretions and loosen the cough. If you don't have any honey, you can use corn syrup.</li><li>AGE 6 years and older: Use COUGH DROPS to decrease the tickle in the throat. If you don't have any, you can use hard candy.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Coughing Fits or Spells:</strong><ul><li>Give warm clear fluids to drink. Examples are apple juice and lemonade.</li><li>Give an extra dose of Benadryl or CTM to stop the breakthrough symptoms.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Avoid Tobacco Smoke:</strong> <ul><li>Tobacco smoke makes coughs much worse.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Wash Pollen Off Body:</strong><ul><li>Remove pollen from the hair and skin with shampoo and a shower. This is really important before bedtime.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Coughing from an allergic substance that can be avoided should go away in hours. Examples are a reaction to pets, a barn, raking leaves or air pollution.</li><li>Coughing during pollen season can last 4-8 weeks. It may return whenever you don't give the allergy medicine. It can flare-up whenever the pollen count goes high.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return to School:</strong> <ul><li>Your child does not need to miss any school for allergies.</li></ul></div>\n",

They are useful only if your child has nasal allergies (hay fever).</li></ul></div><div><strong>Blocked Nose:</strong> <ul><li>Use nasal saline.</li><li>Use saline (salt water) nose spray or drops to loosen up the dried mucus. Next blow or suction the nose. If you don't have saline, use a few drops of bottled water or clean tap water. (If under 1 year old, use bottled water or boiled tap water.)</li><li>Put 2-3 drops in each nostril. Do one side at a time. Then suction or blow. Teens can just splash warm water into the nose. Repeat nasal saline until the return is clear.</li><li><strong>How Often.</strong> Do nasal saline when your child can't breathe through the nose. For babies on a bottle or breast, use nose drops before feeds. Limit: No more than 4 times per day.</li><li>You can buy saline nose drops and sprays in any drug store. To make your own, use 1/2 teaspoon (2 ml) of table salt. Stir the salt into 1 cup (8 ounces or 240 ml) of water. You must use bottled or boiled water for this purpose.</li><li><strong>Sticky Mucus.</strong> Remove it with a wet cotton swab.</li><li><strong>Medicines.</strong> There are no drugs that can remove dried mucus from the nose.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Coughing:</strong> <ul><li>Use homemade cough medicines.</li><li><strong>AGE 3 months to 1 year.</strong> Give warm clear fluids (such as apple juice or lemonade). Dose: 1-3 teaspoons (5-15 ml) four times per day when coughing. Under 3 months, see your child's doctor. Caution: Do not use honey until 1 year old.</li><li><strong>AGE 1 year and older.</strong> Use HONEY 1/2 to 1 tsp (2 to 5 ml) as needed. It thins the secretions and loosens the cough. If you don't have honey, you can use corn syrup. Research shows that honey works better than cough syrups to reduce nighttime coughing.</li><li><strong>AGE 6 years and older.</strong> Use COUGH DROPS to decrease the tickle in the throat. If you don't have any, you can use hard candy.</li><li><strong>Coughing fits.</strong> The warm mist from a shower can help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Fluids: </strong><ul><li>Help your child drink lots of fluids. </li><li>Staying well hydrated thins the body's secretions.

Moist air keeps the nose and airway from drying out. </li><li>Run a warm shower for a while to help put moisture in the air.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Treatment is Not Always Needed:</strong><ul><li>If symptoms aren't bothering your child, they don't need medicine or any treatment. Many children with a cough or cold are happy, play fine and sleep well.</li><li>Only treat symptoms if they cause discomfort or wake your child up. Treat a cough if it's hacking and really bothers your child.</li><li>Fevers are helpful. Only treat them if they slow your child down or cause some discomfort. That does not occur until 102° F (39° C) or higher. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil) can be given. Use to treat higher fever or pain. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Summary:</strong><ul><li> If coughs or colds need treatment, home remedies may work better than medicines.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>COVID-19 Basics</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>COVID-19 Symptoms:</strong> The most common symptoms are cough and fever. Some patients progress to shortness of breath. Other common symptoms are chills, shivering (shaking), runny nose, sore throat, muscle pains or body aches, headache, and loss of smell and taste. The CDC also includes the following less common symptoms: fatigue (tiredness), nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Incubation Period:</strong> average 5 days (range 2 to 14 days) after coming in contact with the secretions of a person who has COVID-19.</li>\n\t<li><strong>No Symptoms but Infected:</strong> Over 30% of infected patients have no symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mild Infections:</strong> 80% of those with symptoms have a mild illness, much like normal flu or a bad cold. The symptoms usually last 2 weeks.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Severe Infections:</strong> 20% of those with symptoms develop trouble breathing from viral pneumonia. Many of these need to be admitted to the hospital. People with complications generally recover in 3 to 6 weeks.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Deaths:</strong> Children generally have a mild illness and recover quickly. Pediatric deaths are very rare. Older adults, especially those with chronic lung disease, heart disease, diabetes or weak immune systems, have the highest death rates. The overall death rate is around 6 per 1000.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vaccine:</strong> Safe and highly effective vaccines are available. Some vaccines are 2 doses, given 3-4 weeks apart. Others are a single dose. Similar to flu shots, they will probably provide protection for 6 to 9 months. At this time, vaccines have been tested and are FDA approved for 12 years and older. Trials on children younger than 12 years have started (May 2021).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Treatment:</strong> New treatments for severe COVID-19 are becoming available. They are mainly used on hospitalized patients and are given in a vein (IV).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Trusted Sources for Accurate COVID-19 Information - CDC and AAP</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>To meet the high demand for COVID-19 information, when possible, find your answers online. Here are the most reliable websites:</li>\n\t<li>CDC website: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus</li>\n\t<li>American Academy of Pediatrics parent website: www.healthychildren.org</li>\n\t<li>Always follow the most current CDC recommendations if they are different than those in this document.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>COVID-19 - How it is Spread</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>COVID-19 is spread from person to person.</li>\n\t<li>The virus spreads from respiratory droplets produced when a person coughs, sneezes, shouts or sings. The infected droplets can then be inhaled by a nearby person or land on the surface of their face or eyes.</li>\n\t<li>Most infected people also have respiratory secretions on their hands. These secretions get transferred to healthy people on doorknobs, faucet handles etc. The virus then gets transferred to healthy people when they touch their face or rub their eyes.</li>\n\t<li>These methods are how most respiratory viruses spread.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C)</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>MIS-C is a very rare complication of COVID-19. In general, COVID-19 continues to be a mild disease in children.</li>\n\t<li>The most common symptoms are fever with red eyes, red lips, red palms and soles. Abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea also occur. Half of the patients develop trouble breathing. MIS-C always has more than two symptoms.</li>\n\t<li>Onset of symptoms: Usually about 4 weeks after a COVID-19 infection and apparent recovery.</li>\n\t<li>Peak age: 8 years. Age range: 6 months to 21 years.</li>\n\t<li>Treatment: MIS-C is treatable with medications, including IV immune serum globulin.</li>\n\t<li>If a child gets this rare complication, a parent will know that their child needs to see a doctor. Patients with MIS-C need to be admitted to the hospital.</li>\n\t<li>Prevention: MIS-C cannot be prevented nor predicted. When approved for this age group, the COVID-19 vaccine will prevent MIS-C.</li>\n</ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>COVID-19 Infection with Mild Symptoms - Overview:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You or your child have been diagnosed as having COVID-19 by a positive lab test OR</li>\n\t<li>You or your doctor suspect COVID-19 because it is widespread in your community and you have developed symptoms that match (cough and/or fever).</li>\n\t<li>Getting a COVID-19 lab test is the only way to know for sure.</li>\n\t<li>Most infections are mild, especially in children.</li>\n\t<li>Here&#39;s some care advice to help the sick person feel better.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Treatment of Symptoms:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The treatment is the same whether you have COVID-19, influenza or some other respiratory virus.</li>\n\t<li>The only difference for COVID-19 is you need to stay on home isolation until you recover. Reason: You want to protect other people from getting it.</li>\n\t<li>Treat the symptoms that are bothering you the most.</li>\n\t<li>There is no anti-viral medication for treating COVID-19 at home.</li>\n\t<li>Antibiotics are not helpful for viral infections.</li>\n\t<li>You don&#39;t need to call or see your doctor unless you develop trouble breathing or become worse in any other way.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Fever Treatment:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For fever above 102 F (39 C), you may use acetaminophen or ibuprofen if the patient is uncomfortable. (See Dosage table).</li>\n\t<li>For fevers 100-102 F (37.8 to 39 C), fever medicines are not needed. Reason: Fever turns on your body&#39;s immune system. Fever helps fight the infection.</li>\n\t<li>Exception: If the patient also has pain, treat it.</li>\n\t<li>Fluids: Offer cool fluids in unlimited amounts. Reason: prevent dehydration. For children younger than 6 months, only give formula or breastmilk. Staying well hydrated helps the body sweat and give off heat.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Homemade Cough Medicine:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Age: 3 Months to 1 year:</li>\n\t<li>Give warm clear fluids (e.g., apple juice or lemonade) to thin the mucus and relax the airway. Dosage: 1-3 teaspoons (5-15 ml) four times per day.</li>\n\t<li>If nothing else helps: Give a small amount of corn syrup. Dosage: 1/4 teaspoon (1 ml). Can give up to 4 times a day when coughing. Caution: Avoid honey until 1 year old (Reason: risk for botulism).</li>\n\t<li>Age 1 year and older: Use Honey 1/2 to 1 teaspoon (2 to 5 ml) as needed as a homemade cough medicine. It can thin the secretions and loosen the cough. (If not available, can use corn syrup.) OTC cough syrups containing honey are also available. They are not more effective than plain honey and cost much more per dose.</li>\n\t<li>Age 6 years and older: Use Cough Drops (throat drops) to decrease the tickle in the throat. If not available, can use hard candy. Avoid cough drops before 6 years. Reason: risk of choking.</li>\n\t<li>OTC cough medicines are not recommended. (Reason: no proven benefit for children.) Honey has been shown to work better.</li>\n\t<li>Don&#39;t use OTC cough medicines under 6 years of age. Reason: Cough is a protective reflex.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Sore Throat Pain Relief:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>COVID-19 often causes a sore throat. Here are some tips on treating it:</li>\n\t<li>Age over 1 year: Can sip warm fluids such as chicken broth or apple juice. Some children prefer cold foods such as popsicles or ice cream.</li>\n\t<li>Age over 6 years: Can also suck on hard candy or lollipops. Butterscotch seems to help.</li>\n\t<li>Age over 8 years: Can also gargle. Use warm water with a little table salt added. A liquid antacid can be added instead of salt. Use Mylanta or the store brand. No prescription is needed.</li>\n\t<li>Pain medicine: Use if pain interferes with swallowing. Not needed for mild pain.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Muscle Pains - Treatment:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>COVID-19 can normally cause muscle pains and body aches.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Massage:</strong> Gently massage any sore muscles.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stretching:</strong> Gently stretch any sore muscles.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Apply Heat:</strong> Use a heat pack, heating pad or warm wet washcloth. Do this for 10 minutes 3 times per day.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Warm bath:</strong> For widespread muscle pains, consider a warm bath for 20 minutes 2 times a day. Gently exercise the sore muscles under water.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pain medicine:</strong> For widespread body aches, give acetaminophen every 4 hours OR ibuprofen every 6 hours as needed. (See Dosage table.) Not needed for mild aches.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Fluids - Stay well Hydrated: </strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Drink lots of fluids. Water is best.</li>\n\t<li>Goal: Keep the patient well hydrated.</li>\n\t<li>It loosens up any phlegm in the lungs. Then it&#39;s easier to cough up.</li>\n\t<li>It helps the body sweat and give off heat.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Home Isolation Is Needed:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Isolation means separating sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick. (CDC) That means stay at home for at least 10 days after symptoms started.</li>\n\t<li>Living with a suspected COVID-19 patient implies close contact has occurred.</li>\n\t<li>Both patient and family members should stay home on isolation and quarantine.</li>\n\t<li>Exceptions: Essential workers who have COVID-19 exposure but do not have any symptoms. Talk to your employer.</li>\n\t<li>The sick person does not need to be confined to a single room. Reason: Preventing spread of respiratory infections within a home is nearly impossible.</li>\n\t<li>The sick person should try to avoid very close contact with other family members. That includes hugging, kissing, sitting next to or sleeping in the same bed. None of this is realistic for young children.</li>\n\t<li>Older children and adults with symptoms may consider wearing a mask in common household areas.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Isolation Questions for Your Doctor:</strong> Home isolation can be complicated. A parent may need to return to work. Someone in the household may be elderly or have a serious medical problem. If you have additional questions, call your doctor during office hours. Your doctor is the best resource for up-to-date information on COVID-19.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>COVID-19 Testing - Talk with your Doctor:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If COVID-19 is suspected, getting a lab test is the only way to know for sure.</li>\n\t<li>Your doctor may provide COVID tests in their office. If not, they will be able to tell you where it would be easiest to schedule one.</li>\n\t<li>Public health department websites also can help you find the closest test site.</li>\n\t<li>Here are some facts that may answer some of your questions:</li>\n\t<li><strong>Diagnostic Tests:</strong> These are performed on nasal or mouth secretions. The test can tell us if you have a COVID-19 infection now. Timing is important on when to do this test:</li>\n\t<li><em>With Symptoms</em>. Get a test within 3 days of onset of symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><em>Without Symptoms with a COVID-19 close contact.</em> Get a test on day 5-7 after exposure. Reason: Testing done during the first 5 days after exposure will usually be negative.</li>\n\t<li>Tests for COVID-19 are mainly done on people who are sick (have symptoms of COVID-19).</li>\n\t<li><em>Serious symptoms</em>. Testing is routinely performed on patients who have serious symptoms or are admitted to the hospital.</li>\n\t<li><em>Mild symptoms.</em> Testing is not always done on patients with mild symptoms who don&#39;t need to be seen.</li>\n\t<li><em>No symptoms.</em> Tests are usually not done on people who have no symptoms, unless they have a close contact with COVID-19.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Repeat diagnostic tests:</strong> After a positive test, repeat tests are not recommended. Even after it is safe to stop isolation (usually 10 days), tests may stay positive for up to 90 days. A positive test does not mean the patient can spread the infection once the required isolation period is completed.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antibody Tests:</strong> These are performed on blood. They can sometimes tell us if you have antibodies from a previous infection. They are not done until at least 2 to 3 weeks have passed from the start of the infection. Talk with your doctor if you have questions about this test.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>How to Protect Others - When You or Your Child are Sick:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Stay home. Don&#39;t go to school or work if you are sick. Don&#39;t go to stores, restaurants, places of worship or other public places. Avoid public transportation or ride sharing. Leave the house only if you need to seek medical care. Your doctor or local health department will tell you when it is safe to return.</li>\n\t<li>No visitors. Do Not allow any visitors, even friends.</li>\n\t<li>Cover the cough. Cough and sneeze into your shirt sleeve or inner elbow. Don&#39;t cough into your hand or the air. If available, sneeze into a tissue and throw it into trash can.</li>\n\t<li>Wash hands often with soap and water. After coughing or sneezing are important times.</li>\n\t<li>Don&#39;t share glasses, plates or eating utensils.</li>\n\t<li>Wear a face mask when around others or you have go to a medical facility.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

This carries the highest risk of transmitting the infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other Close Contact.</strong> The CDC defines 6 feet (2 meters) as how far coughing can spread the virus. How long the close contact lasts can also be important. Prolonged close contact is defined as a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period. (CDC). Close contact includes kissing, hugging or sharing eating and drinking utensils. It also includes close conversations. Direct contact with secretions of a person with COVID-19 is also close contact. Includes being in the same childcare room, classroom or carpool. These exposures are usually lower risk than living with an infected person.</li>\n\t<li><strong>In Same Building - Low Risk Exposure.</strong> Being in the same school, place of worship, workplace or building carries a small risk for exposure. This risk increases if several people have the infection.</li>\n\t<li>I<strong>n Same City - Low Risk Exposure.</strong> Living in or travel from a city or country where there is major community spread of COVID-19, also carries a small risk.

Many of these need to be admitted to the hospital. People with complications generally recover in 3 to 6 weeks.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Deaths:</strong> Children generally have a mild illness and recover quickly. Pediatric deaths are very rare. Older adults, especially those with chronic lung disease, heart disease, diabetes or weak immune systems, have the highest death rates. The overall death rate is around 6 per 1000.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vaccine:</strong> Safe and highly effective vaccines are available. Some vaccines are 2 doses, given 3-4 weeks apart. Others are a single dose. Similar to flu shots, they will probably provide protection for 6 to 9 months. At this time, vaccines have been tested and are FDA approved for 12 years and older.

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>COVID-19 and Flu - How They are Similar</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Presenting Symptoms.</strong> They are nearly the same. You will not be able to tell them apart when you are sick. Fever and cough are the most common symptoms for both. Other respiratory symptoms such as sore throat and runny nose are common for both. Muscle aches and feeling very tired are seen with both. The only helpful symptom is loss of taste or smell. It points to COVID-19, but it only occurs in 15% of patients. It also occurs rarely with flu.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Viral Tests.</strong> Tests are available for both viruses. Both are done with nose or throat swabs. Testing is the only way to tell the right diagnosis. It&#39;s the only way to know for sure what someone has.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Types of Complications.</strong> These are nearly the same. The most common serious symptom is trouble breathing (shortness of breath). It usually means the patient has developed pneumonia. Other complications in young children are croup or wheezing (tight breathing). They are due to a smaller airway and can occur with either virus. The rate of complications, however, is higher with COVID-19.</li>\n\t<li><strong>High-Risk Factors for Complications.</strong> The most common high-risk factors are lung disease, heart disease, diabetes and obesity. The CDC high-risk patient list for influenza is similar to the evolving list for patients with COVID-19.</li>\n\t<li><strong>How it Spreads.</strong> Both are spread person-to-person by respiratory droplets. Droplets are produced by coughing, sneezing, shouting or singing. They get inhaled by a nearby person or quickly fall to the floor or ground. COVID-19 is more contagious than flu and can sometimes spread through the air when people are close together indoors.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infections without Symptoms.</strong> Both infections can occur without causing any symptoms (asymptomatic people). This occurs around 30% or more of the time for both. These people can transmit the disease to others (spreaders). But, spread is at a much lower rate than for people with symptoms. This is one reason why well people should wear masks.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Home Treatment.</strong> It&#39;s the same. Treat the symptoms that bother you the most. Provide symptom relief as needed for the cough, sore throat and fever. Drink extra fluids and stay well hydrated. When tired, get extra rest. See the COVID-19 Diagnosed or Suspected handout for details.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prevention.</strong> Getting the vaccines can help prevent both diseases. Wearing face masks, extra hand washing and social distancing have been proven to help prevent both diseases.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>COVID-19 and Flu - How They Differ</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Antiviral Medication.</strong> Prescription antivirals given by mouth (such as Tamiflu) are only available for influenza. They are mainly prescribed for sick patients who also are high-risk for complications. Healthy people don&#39;t need antiviral medication if they get flu. An antiviral for COVID-19 is sometimes given by vein (IV) to very ill patients in the hospital.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Home Quarantine for Exposed People without Symptoms.</strong> Following close contact with someone who is sick with COVID-19, staying home is required. This is usually for 10 days. Following close contact with someone who is sick with flu, staying home is not required, unless symptoms occur. Home quarantine means avoiding other people.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Home Isolation for Sick People with Symptoms.</strong> Home isolation for COVID-19 is required for 10 days or longer. Home isolation for flu is only recommended until the fever has been gone for at least 24 hours. Reason: COVID-19 is far more dangerous than flu.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Symptom Onset after Exposure.</strong> The incubation period is how many days after close contact with a sick person the symptoms start. Flu starts faster. Flu symptoms start on the average 2 or 3 days after exposure to a sick person. COVID-19 symptoms start on the average 5-7 days after exposure.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Time of Year.</strong> Influenza is seasonal, usually October to April. It peaks December through February. COVID-19 is not seasonal. It will not go away in the spring like influenza.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Severity and Death Rate.</strong> COVID-19 is far more dangerous than flu. Up to 20% of adult patients develop trouble breathing. This is less common in children. COVID-19 has a higher complication rate and ICU admission rate than flu. The death rate for adults is around 6 per 1000 cases. COVID-19 causes about 10 times more deaths than seasonal flu in those who get it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Trusted Sources for Accurate COVID-19 Information - CDC and AAP</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>To meet the high demand for COVID-19 information, when possible, find your answers online.

Age 11 and younger approval is expected by Spring 2022.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Treatment:</strong> New treatments for severe COVID-19 are becoming available.

      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>COVID-19 - How to Protect Yourself and Family from Catching It - The Basics:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Get the COVID-19 vaccine. It is your best protection against this serious infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vaccine Site.</strong> Find a nearby vaccine site at vaccines.gov or call your doctor&#39;s office.</li>\n\t<li>Avoid close contact with people outside your family unit. Avoid closed spaces (indoors) when possible and all crowds (even outdoors).</li>\n\t<li>Always wear a face mask when you leave your home. Also, observe social (safe) distancing.</li>\n\t<li>Wash hands often with soap and water (very important). Always do before you eat.</li>\n\t<li>Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if water is not available. Remember: soap and water work better.</li>\n\t<li>Don&#39;t touch your eyes, nose or mouth unless your hands are clean. Germs on the hands can get into your body this way.</li>\n\t<li>Don&#39;t share glasses, plates or eating utensils.</li>\n\t<li>No longer shake hands. Greet others with a smile and a nod.</li>\n\t<li>If your child needs to be seen for an urgent medical problem, do not hesitate to go in. ERs and urgent care sites are safe places. They are well equipped to protect you against the virus. For non-urgent conditions, talk to your doctor&#39;s office first. Medical offices are also safe places.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Social Distancing and COVID-19 Prevention:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Avoid any contact with people known to have COVID-19 infection. Avoid talking to or sitting close to them.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Social Distancing:</strong> Try to stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from anyone who is sick, especially if they are coughing. Also called physical distancing. Avoid crowds because you can&#39;t tell who might be sick.</li>\n\t<li>If COVID-19 is widespread in your community, try to stay 6 feet away from everyone outside your family unit.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stay at Home Orders:</strong> Follow any stay at home (stay in place) orders in your community. Leave your home only for essential needs such as buying food or seeking medical care.</li>\n\t<li><strong>After Stay at Home Orders are Lifted:</strong> Continue social distancing. Also wear a mask when entering any public building or outdoor crowded area. These precautions will be needed for many months. Your state public health department will decide when they are no longer needed.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Face Masks and COVID-19 Prevention:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Overview:</strong> Face masks are essential for reducing the spread of COVID-19. They will also reduce the spread of flu. Wearing a mask means you care about other people.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Recommended Masks:</strong> Made of 2 or more layers of washable, breathable fabric. Completely cover the nose and mouth. Fits snugly under your chin and against the sides of your face. Neck gaiter masks may not work as well. (CDC)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sick patients:</strong> Must always wear a face mask if need to leave the home. Example: for medical visits. Exception: patients with trouble breathing in a mask can consider a loose face covering such as a bandana.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Well people:</strong> As community spread became high, the CDC also recommends face masks or coverings for everyone going outside the home. They are critical if entering a public building, such as a grocery store. Face masks are required to enter most businesses. Reason: Many people with COVID-19 have no symptoms but can spread the virus.</li>\n\t<li><strong>After the Vaccine:</strong> Continue to wear a mask in public spaces. Reason: reduce the spread of the infection to others.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Well People Exceptions:</strong> Face mask or covering is optional if outdoors in nature and you can avoid being within 6 feet of other people. Examples: on an outdoor walk or run.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Age Limits:</strong> Face coverings also are not recommended for children under 2 years (CDC).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Keep Your Body Strong:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Get your body ready to fight the COVID-19 virus.</li>\n\t<li>Get enough sleep (very important)</li>\n\t<li>Keep your heart strong. Walk or exercise every day. Take the stairs. Caution: avoid physical exhaustion.</li>\n\t<li>Stay well hydrated.</li>\n\t<li>Eat healthy meals. Avoid overeating to deal with your fears.</li>\n\t<li>Avoid the over-use of anti-fever medicines. Fever fights infections and ramps up your immune system</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Keep Your Mind Positive:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Live in the present, not the future.</strong> The future is where your needless worries live.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stay positive.</strong> Use a mantra to reduce your fears, such as &quot;I am strong&quot;.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Get outdoors.</strong> Take daily walks. Go to a park if you have one. Being in nature is good for your immune system.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Show love.</strong> As long as they are well, hug your children and partner frequently. Speak to them in a kind and loving voice. Love strengthens your immune system.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stay in touch.</strong> Use regular phone calls and video chats to stay in touch with those you love.</li>\n\t<li><strong>&quot;2-Household Bubble&quot;</strong>. To reduce social isolation, especially for young children, some families have joined up with one other family for visits. Rules: Both families must agree that they will not have social contacts with any other families. No one in either family can work outside the home. Not approved by CDC but a reasonable family decision.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>How to Protect Others - When You or Your Child are Sick:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Stay home. Don&#39;t go to school or work if you are sick. Don&#39;t go to stores, restaurants, places of worship or other public places. Avoid public transportation or ride sharing. Leave the house only if you need to seek medical care. Your doctor or local health department will tell you when it is safe to return.</li>\n\t<li>No visitors. Do Not allow any visitors, even friends.</li>\n\t<li>Cover the cough. Cough and sneeze into your shirt sleeve or inner elbow. Don&#39;t cough into your hand or the air. If available, sneeze into a tissue and throw it into trash can.</li>\n\t<li>Wash hands often with soap and water. After coughing or sneezing are important times.</li>\n\t<li>Don&#39;t share glasses, plates or eating utensils.</li>\n\t<li>Wear a face mask when around others or you have go to a medical facility.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Vaccine Efficacy.</strong> All the vaccines approved by the FDA for use in the US are highly effective. Most vaccines provide over 90% protection against getting sick with COVID-19. The vaccines are even better at preventing serious symptoms, complications and the need for hospital or ICU admission. They are much more effective than flu vaccines.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other Major Benefits.</strong> Vaccines also prevent the rare serious delayed onset complications from COVID-19 infections that can occur in some people. One example is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (also called MIS-C). Another is &quot;long hauler&quot; symptoms (such as brain fog or chronic breathing problems). Key: Vaccines prevent death and long-term complications from COVID-19 infections.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Safety of the COVID-19 Vaccine:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Vaccine Safety.</strong> Very safe based on tracking thousands of vaccinated people. Most people get a sore arm for a few days. About half get some general symptoms for about 24 hours, such as feeling tired and achy. A smaller number have a fever. These are the normal side effects seen with most vaccines and they go away quickly. They show your immune system is working. Serious reactions are extremely rare.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Blood Clot Concerns</strong>. Very rare. Occur in about 1 person per million vaccinated people. Blood clots occur much more commonly in people who get the natural COVID-19 infection. (Note: have NOT occurred with Moderna or Pfizer vaccines)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Best COVID Vaccine.</strong> Any vaccine approved by the FDA is highly effective and safe. Get the first one that becomes available to you. It will protect you and your family.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vaccine Site. </strong>Find a nearby vaccine site at vaccines.gov or call your doctor&#39;s office.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Protection after the COVID-19 Vaccine:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Start of Vaccine Protection.</strong> Full protection is reached about 2 weeks after you complete the vaccine series.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Duration of Vaccine Protection.</strong> Research data has confirmed that protection is still high at 6 months after completing the vaccine series (April 2021). Experts predict the protection may last for 12 months or longer, but we need to wait for more data.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Booster Shots.</strong> Experts predict we may need them yearly, just like flu vaccine boosters. Ongoing studies will tell.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Reinfection after the COVID-19 Vaccine:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>COVID-19 Variants and Vaccine Protection.</strong> For now, the current vaccines protect against the current variants in the US. The vaccinated person usually does not get infected. If they do, they develop either a mild illness or an asymptomatic infection. They are protected against serious symptoms and any complications. By contrast, natural immunity does not protect against some of the variants.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Re-infections.</strong> Reinfections can occur after natural infections. Vaccination provides much better protection against future infections.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Quarantine after Exposure.</strong> If you are vaccinated and 2 weeks have passed since your final dose, you do not have to quarantine for 10 days after close contact with a COVID-19 infected person.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div><strong>Special Patients and the COVID-19 Vaccine:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Children and Teens</strong>. Safe and highly effective vaccines are available. Some vaccines are 2 doses, given 3-4 weeks apart. Others are single dose. Similar to flu shots, they will probably provide protection for 6 to 9 months. At this time, vaccines have been tested and are FDA approved for 12 years and older. Trials on children younger than 12 years have started (May 2021). Importance: while most children have mild or asymptomatic infections, they can get rare complications such as MIS-C. Also, they can innocently transmit the disease to others.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pregnant Women.</strong> Vaccines are approved and safe.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Breastfeeding Mothers.</strong> Vaccines are approved and safe. Studies show that breastmilk passes antibody protection against COVID-19 to the baby.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Underlying High Risk Conditions.</strong> Vaccines are approved and safe. These patients need the vaccine protection the most. If you have questions about a specific condition, discuss with your doctor.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Person Already had the Disease.</strong> Get the vaccine. It provides higher levels of antibodies and better protection than the natural disease. Restriction: not approved until you are over any acute symptoms and the 10 days of isolation have passed.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

Do this for 15 minutes before shampooing to soften the crusts.</li><li>Wash all the oil off, however, or it may worsen the cradle cap. (Reason: The oil blocks the oil glands on the baby's scalp.)</li><li>Do not use olive oil.

Usually, it doesn't cause any symptoms (such as pain or itching).</li><li>Therefore, treatment is optional. It is mainly done for cosmetic reasons.</li><li>Shampoos, lotions and brushing will reduce the thickness of the scales. They will usually make them go away sooner.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return to Child Care:</strong><ul><li>Cradle cap cannot be spread to others. </li><li>Your child does not need to miss any child care.</li></ul> </div>\n",

Caution: Do not use honey until 1 year old.</li><li>AGE 1 year and older: Use HONEY ½ teaspoon (2 ml) as needed. It's the best homemade cough medicine. It can thin the secretions and loosen the cough. If you don't have any honey, you can use corn syrup.</li><li>AGE 6 years and older: Use COUGH DROPS or throat drops to decrease the tickle in the throat. If you don't have any, you can use hard candy.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Drug Store Cough Medicine (DM):</strong><ul><li>Don't give any non-prescription cough medicines to young children.

They usually need closure with sutures or skin glue.</li><li>Any open wound that may need sutures should be seen as soon as possible. Ideally, they should be checked and closed within 6 hours. Reason: To prevent wound infections.

Reason: Can't breathe while sucking.</li><li><strong>Common cause.</strong> Nausea (upset stomach) from a virus, but without vomiting.</li><li><strong>Trouble breathing</strong> with a viral illness that affects breathing such as croup. Reason: Baby gets tired out from sucking and breathing at the same time.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Dehydration: How to Know</strong></p><ul><li>Dehydration means that the body has lost too much fluid. These are signs of dehydration:</li><li>Decreased urine (no urine in more than 8 hours) happens early in dehydration. So does a dark yellow color. If the urine is light straw colored, your child is not dehydrated.</li><li>Dry tongue and inside of the mouth. Dry lips are not helpful.</li><li>Dry eyes with decreased or absent tears</li><li>In babies, a depressed or sunken soft spot</li><li>Slow blood refill test: Longer than 2 seconds. First, press on the thumbnail and make it pale. Then let go. Count the seconds it takes for the nail to turn pink again. Ask your doctor to teach you how to do this test.</li><li>Fussy, tired out or acting ill. If your child is alert, happy and playful, he or she is not dehydrated.</li><li>A child with severe dehydration becomes too weak to stand. They can also be very dizzy when trying to stand.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"> </p>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>Eating less solids during an illness is normal. Drinking less fluids is not.</li><li>The main risk for your child is getting dehydrated. Dehydration means the body has lost too much fluid. Usually that's defined as losing 5% or more of body weight.</li><li>Your job is to increase fluid intake.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Offer Lots of Fluids:</strong> <ul><li>Give your child lots of their favorite liquid.</li><li>Age under 1 year: Continue offering formula or breast milk. You can also try ORS (such as Pedialyte). </li><li>Age over 1 year: Offer chocolate or regular milk, fruit drinks, juice or water. You can also try popsicles.</li><li>The type of fluid doesn't matter, as it does with diarrhea or vomiting.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Solid Foods:</strong><ul><li>Don't worry about solid food intake.</li><li>It's normal not to feel hungry or want to eat when sick. </li><li>Preventing dehydration is the only thing that is important. </li></ul></div><div><strong>For A Sore Mouth: </strong><ul><li>If the mouth is sore, give cold drinks.</li><li>Do not use citrus juices.</li><li>For babies, offer fluids in a cup, spoon or syringe rather than a bottle. Reason: The nipple may increase pain. </li><li>To help with the pain, give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Liquid Antacid for Mouth Sores:</strong><ul><li>For mouth pain, use a liquid antacid such as Mylanta or the store brand. Give 4 times per day as needed. After meals often is a good time. Age: Use for children over 1 year old.</li><li>For children over age 6, can use 1 teaspoon (5 ml) as a mouth wash. Keep it on the ulcers as long as possible. Then can spit it out or swallow it.</li><li>For younger children age 1 to 6, put a few drops in the mouth. Can also put it on with a cotton swab.</li><li>Caution: Do not use regular mouth washes, because they sting.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Nasal Washes To Open a Blocked Nose:</strong><ul><li>Use saline nose drops or spray to loosen up the dried mucus. If you don't have saline, you can use clean tap water. (If under 1 year old, use distilled water or boiled tap water.)</li><li>STEP 1: Put 3 drops in each nostril. (If age under 1 year old, use 1 drop. Also, do 1 side at a time.)</li><li>STEP 2: Blow (or suction) each nostril out while closing off the other nostril. Then, do the other side.</li><li>STEP 3: Repeat nose drops and blowing (or suctioning) until the discharge is clear.</li><li>How often: Do nasal washes when your child can't breathe through the nose. Limit: No more than 4 times per day.</li><li>Saline nose drops or spray can be bought in any drugstore. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Saline nose drops can also be made at home. Use 1/2 teaspoon (2 ml) of table salt. Stir the salt into 1 cup (8 ounces or 240 ml) of water. You must use distilled or boiled water for this purpose.</li><li>Reason for nose drops: Suction or blowing alone can't remove dried or sticky mucus. Also, babies can't nurse or drink from a bottle unless the nose is open.</li><li>Other option: use a warm shower to loosen mucus. Breathe in the moist air, then blow each nostril.</li><li>For young children, can also use a wet cotton swab to remove sticky mucus.</li></ul></div><div><strong>For Shortness of Breath: </strong><ul><li>For trouble breathing, feed more often. Feed every ½ hour. </li><li>Offer smaller amounts per feeding. </li><li>Reason: This allows your baby to rest in between feedings. </li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Normal appetite should gradually come back.</li><li>Sometimes, it takes a week.</li><li>It depends on your cause of your child's illness.</li></ul></div>\n",

Fluid is normally made here in small amounts.</li><li>Usually, the fluid drains out of the ear through a tube. This tube is called the eustachian tube. It allows the fluid to drain into the back of the throat.</li><li>After a cold or ear infection, the eustachian tube may become swollen. The swelling causes it to be blocked for a short time.

If hearing loss occurs before age 2, it may affect normal speech development. The fluid will probably clear in 1 to 2 months. Most children's speech will catch up after a short-term hearing loss. In the meantime, help your child deal with the limited hearing. When you talk with your child:</li><li>Get close to your child, get eye contact, and get his full attention. At times, check that he understands what you have said.</li><li>Speak in a louder voice than you normally use. A common mistake is to assume your child is ignoring you. In reality, he doesn't hear you.</li><li>Reduce any background noise from radio or television while talking with your child.</li><li>If your child goes to school, be sure he sits in front. Have him sit near the teacher. Middle ear fluid interferes with the ability to hear in a crowd or classroom.</li></ul></div><div><strong>No Restrictions:</strong><ul><li>Your child doesn't have any restrictions because of ear fluid. Your child can go outside and does not need to cover the ears.</li><li>Swimming is allowed unless there is a tear or hole in the eardrum. Also, if your child has ear tubes or ear drainage, he should not swim.</li><li>Air travel or a trip to the mountains is safe. Have your child swallow fluids or suck on a pacifier during descent. Children over age 6 can also chew gum during this time.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Allergy Medicines:</strong><ul><li>Nose allergies can cause ear stuffiness.</li><li>If your child has hay fever or other allergies, give an allergy medicine. An example is Benadryl.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Antibiotics Not Needed:</strong><ul><li>Antibiotics do not help to clear middle ear fluid.</li><li>Your child doesn't need an antibiotic unless he develops a bacterial ear infection.</li><li>Your child's doctor decides this based upon an ear exam.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>The middle ear fluid clears up by itself in 90% of children. Therefore, no treatment is needed for most children. The fluid will slowly go away.</li><li>By 1 month, 50% of children will still have fluid.</li><li>By 2 months, 20% of children will still have fluid.</li><li>By 3 months, only 10% of children will still have fluid.</li><li>Ear fluid that is still present after 3 to 4 months may need other treatment. Some children need ear tubes placed by an ear surgeon. Reason: The fluid will most likely not clear up by itself.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ear Recheck</strong>:<ul><li>Your child needs to be checked again. Reason: To be sure the ear fluid doesn't last longer than 3 months. The doctor will also want to check your child's speech development.</li></ul></div>\n",

This is from the pressure in the middle ear. The ear then drains cloudy fluid or pus. This small hole most often heals over in 2 or 3 days.</li><li>Symptoms of a common cold usually also present. This includes a runny or congested nose, and a cough.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p><ul><li>A doctor can diagnose a bacterial ear infection by looking at the eardrum. It will be bulging and have pus behind it.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Cause</strong></p><ul><li>Blocked eustachian tube, usually as part of a common cold. The eustachian tube joins the middle ear to the back of the throat. Blockage results in middle ear fluid (called viral otitis). If the fluid becomes infected (bacterial otitis), the fluid turns to pus. This causes the eardrum to bulge out and can cause a lot of pain.</li><li>Ear infections peak at age 6 months to 2 years. They are a common problem until age 8.</li><li>The onset of ear infections is often on day 3 of a cold.</li><li>How often do kids get ear infections? 90% of children have at least 1 ear infection. Frequent ear infections occur in 20% of children. Ear infections are the most common bacterial infection of young children.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Recurrent Ear Infections</strong></p><ul><li>Avoid exposure to tobacco smoke.</li><li>During the first year of life, try to reduce contact with other sick children.

The eustachian tube joins the middle ear to the back of the throat. Blockage results in middle ear fluid (called viral otitis). If the fluid becomes infected (bacterial otitis), the fluid turns to pus. This causes the eardrum to bulge out and can cause a lot of pain.</li><li>Ear infections peak at age 6 months to 2 years. They are a common problem until age 8.</li><li>The onset of ear infections is often on day 3 of a cold.</li><li>How often do kids get ear infections? 90% of children have at least 1 ear infection. Frequent ear infections occur in 20% of children. Ear infections are the most common bacterial infection of young children.</li></ul>\n",

It also makes them harder to treat.</li><li>No one should smoke around your child. This includes in your home, your car or at child care.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Breastfeed:</strong><ul><li>Breastfeed your baby during the first 6 to 12 months of life.</li><li>Antibodies in breast milk lower the rate of ear infections.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Do Not Prop the Bottle:</strong><ul><li>During feedings, hold your baby with the head higher than the stomach.</li><li>Feeding while lying down flat can lead to ear infections. Reason: It causes formula to flow back into the middle ear.</li><li>Also, don't let babies hold their own bottle. This also causes milk to drain into the middle ear.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Get All Suggested Vaccines:</strong><ul><li>Vaccines protect your child from serious infections.</li><li>The pneumococcal and flu shots also help to prevent some ear infections.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Try To Avoid Colds</strong>:<ul><li>Most ear infections start with a cold. During the first year of life, try to reduce contact with other sick children.</li><li>Try to put off using a large child care center during the first year. Instead, try using a sitter in your home. Another option might be a small home-based child care.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Check Any Snoring:</strong><ul><li>Large adenoids can cause snoring or mouth breathing. Suspect this if your toddler snores every night or breathes through his mouth.</li><li>Large adenoids can contribute to ear infections.</li><li>Talk to your child's doctor about this.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Control Allergies:</strong><ul><li>Allergies may lead to some ear infections. Reason: by causing nose and ear congestion. </li><li>If your baby has a constant runny or blocked nose, suspect an allergy.</li><li>If your child has other allergies such as eczema, he may have a milk allergy. It can be to cow's milk or soy milk protein. </li><li>For any allergy symptoms, talk with your child's doctor.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ear Tubes Surgery:</strong><ul><li>Ear tubes help the middle ear to drain and heal.</li><li>Ear infections that occur 3 or more times in 6 months may need tubes.</li><li>Ear infections that do not clear up after trying many antibiotics may need tubes.</li><li>If prevention fails, your child's doctor may consider ear tubes.</li></ul></div>\n",

Both ears have fluid.</li><li>Also, the fluid has caused a hearing loss greater than 20 decibels.</li><li>Hearing should be tested first. Some children have nearly normal hearing and tubes are not needed.</li><li>Ear infections that occur 3 or more times in 6 months may need tubes.</li><li>Ear infections that occur 4 or more times in 12 months may need tubes.</li><li>Ear infections that do not clear up after trying many antibiotics may need tubes.</li><li>Prevention should be tried before turning to surgery. Examples: Avoid second hand smoke exposure and stop any pacifiers.</li><li>Talk to your child's doctor about ear tubes and if they could help your child.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Benefits of Ear Tube Surgery</strong></p><ul><li>Most children notice hearing is quickly improved after surgery.</li><li>Better hearing helps language development.</li><li>Better hearing continues as long as the ear tubes are open.</li><li>The ear infection rate also improves.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Risks of Ear Tube Surgery</strong></p><ul><li>After the tubes come out, they may leave scars on the eardrum. They may also leave a small hole that doesn't heal. Both of these problems can cause a small hearing loss.</li><li>There is also a small risk when giving anesthesia to young children.</li><li>Therefore, doctors recommend ear tubes only for children who really need them.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview: </strong><ul><li>Ear tube placement is the most common type of surgery performed on children in the US.</li><li>The surgery is done as an outpatient. It takes about 20 minutes.</li><li>The tubes stay in place without any stitches (sutures).</li><li>In general, ear tube surgery is very safe and gives good results.</li><li>Ear tubes allow fluid to drain out of the middle ear space and air to re-enter. That allows the middle ear to become dry and heal.</li><li>This returns the hearing to normal.</li><li>It also lowers the risk of repeated ear infections.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Water Precautions with Ear Tubes:</strong><ul><li>Follow the advice of your ENT surgeon.</li><li>Most children will not need restrictions on swimming or bathing. Exception: All children should avoid getting dirty or soapy water in their ears. Avoid taking bubble baths.</li><li>For children with active or recurrent ear discharge, the following precautions apply:</li><li>Avoid swimming in lakes, ponds, and rivers. Reason: often contaminated water. Ocean water is generally safe.</li><li>Treated swimming pools are usually safe.</li><li>Avoid diving and underwater swimming deeper than 5 feet. </li><li>Surface swimming is safe.</li><li>Note: ear plugs and swim caps usually are not helpful.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Travel Restrictions with Ear Tubes:</strong><ul><li>There are none.</li><li>Your child may fly with ear tubes.</li><li>Your child may also go to the mountains.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>In most cases, the tubes come out between 6 and 18 months. They fall out of the eardrum on their own.</li><li>If the ear tubes come out too soon, frequent ear infections may return. About 20% of children need a second set of ear tubes.</li><li>If the tubes stay in over 2 years, talk with your child's doctor. They probably are no longer needed. The surgeon may need to take them out.</li></ul></div>\n",

With air travel the eardrum can get pushed inward. </li><li>Why does it hurt? First, the ear tube that connects the upper throat to the ear gets blocked. Then air can't get into the middle ear space to equalize the air pressure. The outside air pressure increases during descent. It pushes the eardrum inward. This causes pain.</li><li>More risk if already congested with a cold or nasal allergies.</li><li>Mountain driving can cause similar symptoms.</li><li>Has nothing to do with an ear infection.

Use as needed. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Techniques to Open the Ear Tube: </strong><ul><li>Try to open up the ear tube. (Also known as popping the ears.)</li><li><strong>Yawning technique</strong>. That means repeated jaw stretching yawning.</li><li><strong>Low pressure technique.</strong> Swallow a fluid while the nose is pinched closed. Reason: Makes a vacuum in the nose that helps the ear tube open up.</li><li><strong>High pressure technique.</strong> Take a deep breath. Pinch your nose and close your mouth.

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></p><ul><li>Too much earwax can cause rubbing of the ear or poking in the canal.</li><li>A piece of ear wax can become dry and hard in the ear canal. This creates a feeling that an object is in the ear.</li><li>Complete blockage (plugging) of the ear canal by wax causes more symptoms. These include decreased or muffled hearing.</li><li>A large piece of earwax may be seen inside the ear canal.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Causes</strong></p><ul><li>Usually from using cotton swabs. They push the wax back in and pack it down.</li><li>A few children (perhaps 5%) normally produce more wax than others. It usually will come out if it's not pushed back by fingers.</li><li>Wearing ear plugs of any type can also push wax back.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Earwax is Normal</strong></p><ul><li>Everyone has earwax. Earwax is normal and healthy. Earwax is not dirty or a sign of poor hygiene.</li><li>Earwax is also called cerumen.</li><li>Earwax is made by special glands in the outer third of the ear canal.</li><li>Earwax protects the skin lining the ear canal. It is a natural water-proofing agent.</li><li>Earwax also has germ-killing properties.</li><li>New earwax is soft and a golden-yellow color.</li><li>Older earwax becomes dryer and turns to a brown or black color.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Ear Canals are Self-Cleaning</strong></p><ul><li>Ear canals are designed to clean themselves.</li><li>The ear canal skin slowly moves out of the ear canal. It carries the earwax along with it. The wax dries up and becomes flaky. It falls out of the ear on its own.</li><li>There are some people who produce much more earwax than others. For such people periodic ear cleaning may be needed.</li><li>Earwax only needs to be removed from inside the ear if it causes symptoms. Examples of symptoms are decreased hearing, discomfort, fullness or blockage.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Problems From Using Cotton-Tipped Swabs</strong></p><ul><li>The cotton-tipped swab pushes the wax back in. The earwax builds up and causes symptoms.</li><li>Decreased or muffled hearing.</li><li>Blocked or full ear canal sensation.</li><li>Trapped water behind the wax (can lead to Swimmer's Ear).</li><li>Itchy or painful canals, especially in teens who frequently use Q-tips. A dry ear canal is always itchy.</li><li>Cotton swabs cause over 10,000 ear injuries each year in the US. Over 2,000 are punctured eardrums. Many occur in young children who are allowed to play with cotton swabs.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Blocked Ear Canals:</strong></p><ul><li>Never put cotton-tipped swabs (cotton buds or Q-tips) into the ear canal.</li><li>Cotton swabs just push the earwax deeper into the ear canal. (Reason: Q-tips are usually wider than a child's ear canal).</li><li>Earwax doesn't need any help getting out. You can't hurry the process.</li><li>Never try to dig out pieces of earwax with toothpicks, match sticks or other devices. Usually, doing this just pushes the wax back in.</li><li>These objects can also scratch the ear canal and cause an infection.</li><li>If all of the ear wax is removed (as with Q-tips), the ear canals become itchy and prone to swimmer's ear. This can occur in teens when cotton swabs are smaller than the ear canal.</li><li>Limit the use of ear plugs.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>In general, leave earwax alone.</li><li>It will come out and fall away on its own</li><li>If you see some wax right at the opening, you can flick it away. Better yet, have someone else do it. Use something that won't push it back in, such as a paper clip.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Reasons to Flush out the Ear Canal:</strong><ul><li>Earwax is completely blocking an ear canal and can't hear on that side.</li><li>If the hearing seems normal on that side, the blockage is only partial. You can leave it alone.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ear Canal Flushing with Water</strong>:<ul><li>Age Limit: 6 years and older. Under age 6, use only if advised by your child's doctor.</li><li>Buy a soft rubber ear syringe or bulb from the pharmacy. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Have your child lean over the sink (Reason: To catch the water)</li><li>Use lukewarm water (body temperature). (Reason: To prevent dizziness)</li><li>GENTLY squirt the water into the ear canal. Then tilt your child's head and let the water run out. You may need to do this several (3-4) times.</li><li>If the earwax does not seem to be coming out, tilt the head. Then, flush with the blocked ear facing downward. Gravity will help the water wash it out (the waterfall effect).</li><li>Endpoint: Flush until the water that comes out is clear of earwax. Also, the ear canal should be open when you look in with a light.</li><li>Afterwards dry the ear thoroughly. You can do this by putting a drop of rubbing alcohol in the ear canal. Or you can set a hair dryer on low. Hold it a foot away from the ear for 10 seconds.</li></ul></div><div><strong>CAUTION - Ear Canal Flushing:</strong><ul><li>Do NOT perform flushing if your child has a hole in the eardrum or ear tubes.</li><li>STOP flushing if it causes pain or dizziness</li><li>Do NOT use a water jet tooth cleaner (such as a WaterPik) for ear flushing. Reason: The force of the jet can cause pain.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ear Drops - Use for 4 Days to Soften the Earwax:</strong><ul><li>If the earwax is hard, soften it before flushing the ear canal. Use ear drops to break up the earwax.</li><li>Homemade ear drops: hydrogen peroxide and water mix. Use equal parts of each.</li><li>Other option: mild baking soda solution. Make it by adding ¼ teaspoon (1.25 mL) of baking soda to 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of water.</li><li>Drug store option: Debrox or Murine earwax removal drops. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Use 5 drops in affected ear, 2 times daily, for 4 days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>How to Use Ear Drops:</strong><ul><li>Lie on the side with blocked ear upward.</li><li>Place 5 drops into ear canal.</li><li>Keep drops in ear for 10 minutes. </li><li>Then lie with the blocked side down and let the ear drops run out on some tissue.</li><li>Use twice daily for up to four days.</li><li>Then flushing should be able to get everything out.</li></ul></div><div><strong>CAUTION - Ear Drops:</strong><ul><li>Do NOT use ear drops if your child has a hole in the eardrum. Also do not use them for children with ear tubes.</li><li>STOP using ear drops if pain occurs.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Earwax Removal Before 6 Years Old:</strong><ul><li>Earwax removal in this age group can be hard.</li><li>Removal may not be needed. The ear wax should come out on its own. Don't use cotton swabs.</li><li>Do not use eardrops or ear flushes unless it is advised by your child's doctor. This also can be done in your doctor's office.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Once the wax is removed, the hearing should return to normal.</li><li>After 24 hours, the ear canal should feel normal.</li><li>If you stop using cotton swabs, ear wax should come out on its own. There are a few families where clogged earwax is a recurrent problem.</li></ul></div>\n",

If it doesn't itch, it's not eczema.</li><li>With flare-ups (itching attacks), the rash becomes red or even raw and weepy.</li><li>Onset: Average onset at 3 months old. Range: 1-6 months old. Usually begins by 2 years old.</li><li>Location: Classic eczema starts on the cheeks at 1 to 6 months of age. It can spread to the rest of the face. In infants, the outer surfaces of the arms and legs also become involved.</li><li>In older children, eczema is found in the joint creases. The elbows, wrists, and knees are the most common places.</li><li>The rash is usually the same on both sides of the body.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Cause</strong></p><ul><li>A type of dry, sensitive skin that's inherited.</li><li>Flare-ups are from skin contact with soap, shampoo, pollen or other irritating substances.</li><li>About 30% of babies with severe eczema also have food allergies. The most common is cow's milk.</li><li>Over 10% of children have eczema. It's the most common skin condition of the first 10 years.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention - Avoid Triggers of Eczema Flare-Ups</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Soaps.</strong> Never use bubble bath. It can cause a major flare-up.</li><li><strong>Pollens.</strong> Keep your child from lying on the grass during grass pollen season.</li><li><strong>Animals.</strong> Avoid any animals that make the rash worse.</li><li><strong>Foods.</strong> If certain foods cause severe itching (flares), avoid them.</li><li><strong>Wool.</strong> Avoid wool fibers and clothes made of other scratchy, rough materials.</li><li><strong>Dry Air.</strong> Use a humidifier if the air in your home is dry.</li><li><strong>Caution:</strong> Keep your child away from anyone with fever blisters (cold sores). The herpes virus can cause a serious skin infection in children with eczema.</li><li>Don't worry about which detergent you use to wash clothing.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>Eczema is a chronic skin disease. So, you need to learn how to control it.</li><li>Itching attacks (flare-ups) are to be expected.</li><li>The goal is to treat all flare-ups quickly and vigorously. (Reason: To prevent skin damage)</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Treatment Based on Severity of Eczema:</strong><ul><li>Mild Eczema: Just need moisturizer cream and to avoid flare-up triggers</li><li>Moderate Eczema: Also needs steroid cream and bedtime allergy medicine</li><li>Severe Eczema: Also may need oral antibiotics (usually for 2 weeks). Several new prescription medicines can bring most severe eczema under control. Discuss with your doctor.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Steroid Cream or Ointment (Rescue Medicine):</strong>  <ul><li>Itchy skin is the main symptom of eczema.</li><li>Steroid creams or ointments are essential for controlling red, itchy skin.</li><li>Apply steroid creams only to itchy or red spots (not to the normal skin). </li><li>Most children have 2 types of steroid creams. (1) A mild steroid cream to treat any pink spots or mild itching. This is often 1% hydrocortisone cream. No prescription is needed. (2) Another stronger cream to treat any spots with severe itching. This is a prescription steroid cream such as Synalar. Never apply this stronger cream to the face.</li><li>Apply these creams as directed or 2 times per day.</li><li>After the rash quiets down, apply it once per day. After 1 week just use moisturizing cream.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Moisturizing Creams or Ointment (Controller Medicine):</strong> <ul><li>All children with eczema have dry sensitive skin.</li><li>The skin needs a moisturizing cream applied once or twice daily. Examples: Cetaphil cream.</li><li>Apply the creams after a 5 or 10-minute bath. To trap moisture in the skin, apply the cream while skin is still damp. Do this within 3 minutes of leaving the bath or shower.</li><li>The steroid cream should be applied to any itchy spots first. Then use the moisturizing cream as the top layer.</li><li>While most parents prefer creams, moisturizing ointments are sometimes needed in the winter. Examples are Vaseline and Aquaphor.</li><li>Caution: Never stop the moisturizing cream. Reason: The rash will come back.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Bathing - Avoid Soaps:</strong> <ul><li>Give one bath a day for 10 minutes in lukewarm water. Reason: Water-soaked skin feels less itchy. Follow the bath with a moisturizing cream to all the skin.</li><li>Avoid all soaps. Reason: Eczema is very sensitive to soaps, especially bubble bath. There is no safe soap for young children with eczema. They can be cleaned using warm water.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Allergy Medicine:</strong><ul><li>Many children with eczema need an allergy medicine by mouth at bedtime. Reason: Scratching in bed can cause severe skin breakdown. It may also interfere with falling asleep.</li><li>Give the medicine your child's doctor suggested.</li><li>If none was suggested and over 1 year old, give Benadryl. No prescription is needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Itching Attack - Shower to Remove Irritants: </strong><ul><li>Playing in the grass, being around animals, or swimming can cause increased itching. </li><li>For itching from these causes, give your child a quick shampoo and shower.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Itching Attack - Treatment: </strong><ul><li>At the first sign of any itching, use the steroid cream. Put it on the areas that itch. If unsure, apply 1% hydrocortisone cream. No prescription is needed. </li><li>Keep your child's fingernails cut short and smooth.</li><li>Ask older children to try not to itch, but never punish for itching.</li><li>For constant itching in young children, cover the hands with socks or gloves. Use for a day or until the itching is brought under control. Provide extra cuddling during this time. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Expected Course: </strong><ul><li>Eczema is a chronic condition. After puberty, about half get over their eczema. </li><li>Many children who have severe eczema as babies develop asthma and nasal allergies.</li></ul></div>\n",

Suspect this in children who can't sleep or can only fall asleep briefly. When awake, they will not join in any normal activities. They won't play or be distracted. They may be very hard to console.</li><li>Caution: Instead of crying, severe pain may cause your child to moan or whimper.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Can't Walk</strong><ul><li>If your child has learned to walk and then suddenly won't, call your doctor. He may have a serious injury to the legs or a problem with balance. If your child walks bent over holding his belly, he may have appendicitis.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Vomits Bile</strong><ul><li>Vomiting that is bright green is most often bile. Unless your child drank a green liquid, this is not normal. It can mean the intestines are blocked up. This is a surgical emergency.</li><li>Note: Vomiting some yellow fluid is normal. The yellow color is from stomach acid.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Tender Belly</strong><ul><li>Press on your child's belly while she is distracted by a toy or book. You should be able to press in an inch or so without a problem. If your child winces or screams, it suggests a serious cause. If the belly is also bloated and hard, it's more urgent.</li><li>Note: If your child just pushes your hand away, you haven't distracted her enough.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Pain in Testicle or Scrotum</strong><ul><li>Sudden pain in the scrotum can be from twisting (torsion) of the testicle.</li><li>This needs surgery within 8 hours to save the testicle.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Trouble Breathing</strong><ul><li>Breathing is essential for life. Most childhood deaths are caused by severe breathing problems.</li><li>Breathing problems can be caused by throat or lung infections.</li><li>Parents need to learn to recognize trouble breathing.</li><li>If your child has tight croup or wheezing, they need to be seen now.</li><li>Other bad signs are fast breathing, grunting with each breath, bluish lips, or retractions. This means the skin pulls in between the ribs with each breath. It is a sign of trouble breathing in younger children.</li><li>Children with severe breathing problems can't drink, talk or cry.</li><li>If your child is struggling to breathe, call 911.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Bluish or Gray Lips</strong><ul><li>Bluish lips, tongue, or gums can mean not enough oxygen in the bloodstream. Call 911.</li><li>Note: Bluish skin only around the mouth (not the lips) can be normal. It can be caused by being cold or being afraid.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Trouble Swallowing with Drooling</strong><ul><li>The sudden onset of drooling or spitting means your child is having trouble swallowing. Most often, this is from severe swelling in the throat.</li><li>The cause can be a serious throat infection.</li><li>A serious allergic reaction can also cause trouble swallowing.</li><li>Swelling in the throat could close off the airway.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Dehydration</strong><ul><li>Dehydration means that your child's body fluids are low. Dehydration often is caused by severe vomiting and/or diarrhea.</li><li>Suspect dehydration if your child has not urinated in 8 hours. Crying no tears and a dry inside of the mouth (tongue) are also signs. In young babies, the soft spot in the head is sunken. Dehydrated children are also tired and weak.</li><li>Note: If your child is alert, playful and active, he is not yet dehydrated.</li><li>Children with severe dehydration become dizzy when they stand.</li><li>Dehydration needs extra fluids by mouth or vein.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Bulging Soft Spot</strong><ul><li>The soft spot in your baby's head is tense and bulging. This means the brain is under pressure.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stiff Neck</strong><ul><li>A stiff neck means your child can't touch the chin to the chest. To test for a stiff neck, lay your child down. Then lift his head until the chin touches the chest. If he fights you, place a toy or coin on the belly. This makes him have to look down to see it.</li><li>Older children can simply be asked to look at their belly button.</li><li>A stiff neck can be an early sign of meningitis.</li><li>Note: Without fever, a stiff neck is often from sore neck muscles.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Neck Injury</strong><ul><li>Talk to your child's doctor about any neck injury, regardless of the symptoms. Neck injuries carry a risk of damage to the spinal cord.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Purple or Blood-red Spots or Dots</strong><ul><li>Purple or blood-red spots or dots on the skin need to be seen. When present with fever, they could be a sign of a serious bloodstream infection.</li><li>The color of these serious rashes will not change when you press on them. The color of normal viral rashes will fade with skin pressure.</li><li>Note: Bumps and bruises on the shins from active play are different.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Fever (over 100.4° F or 38° C) in the First 3 Months</strong><ul><li>Fevers in newborns and young babies are treated differently than fevers in older children. Bacterial infections are more common at this age and can get worse quickly.</li><li>All babies under 3 months of age with a fever need to be seen now. They need tests to decide if the cause is viral or bacterial.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Fever Over 105° F (40.6° C)</strong><ul><li>A fever tells you that your child has an infection.</li><li>Serious infections can occur with low-grade fevers as well as higher fevers. All the above symptoms are stronger signs of serious illness than the level of fever. Research shows fevers alone are a risk factor only when very high. That means levels above 105° F (40.6° C).</li><li>So, call your doctor if your child's fever goes above 104° F (40° C). This is a safe rule.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Chronic Disease Complication</strong><ul><li>Most active chronic diseases can have some serious complications.</li><li>If your child has a chronic disease, learn what those complications are. Find out how to recognize the early changes.</li><li>Diseases at highest risk for serious infections are those that weaken the immune system. These include sickle cell disease, HIV, cancer, organ transplant, or taking oral steroids.</li><li>If you are talking with health workers who don't know your child, speak up. Always tell them about your child's chronic disease (such as asthma). Never assume the doctors and nurses already know this.</li></ul></div>\n",

Pollens travel in the air.</li><li><strong>Pets</strong> - cats, dogs, rabbits, horses. Animal allergens get in the eyes from the hands. They can also be in the air.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>An eye allergy most often is caused by pollen that gets in the eye.</li><li>The eyes can itch, burn or sting. </li><li>All of these symptoms can go away with allergy eye drops.</li><li>Eye allergies are common. They occur in 10% of children.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Wash Allergens Off the Face: </strong><ul><li>Use a wet washcloth to clean off the eyelids and face.</li><li>Rinse the eyes with a small amount of warm water. Tears will do the rest.</li><li>Then put a cold wet washcloth on the itchy eye.</li><li>Prevention: Wash the hair every night because it collects lots of pollen.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Oral Allergy Medicines:</strong> <ul><li>If the nose is also itchy and runny, your child probably has hay fever. Hay fever is allergic symptoms of both the nose and eyes.</li><li>Give your child an allergy medicine by mouth. This should get rid of the nose and the eye symptoms. Most often, eye drops will not be needed.</li><li>A short-acting allergy medicine (such as Benadryl) may be helpful. No prescription is needed.  It needs to be given every 6 to 8 hours. The bedtime dosage is especially helpful for healing the lining of the nose.</li><li>Long-acting allergy medicines (such as Zyrtec or Allegra) can also be used. Again, no prescription is needed. They have 2 advantages over Benadryl.  They cause less sedation. They are also longer-acting and last up to 24 hours.</li><li>Give allergy medicine every day. Do this until pollen season is over (about 2 months for each pollen).</li></ul></div><div><strong>Newer Antihistamine Eye Drops (Ketotifen) for Pollen Allergies - 1st Choice:</strong><ul><li>Usually, an oral allergy medicine will control the allergic symptoms of the eye.</li><li>If the eyes remain itchy and poorly controlled, buy some Ketotifen antihistamine eye drops. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Dose: 1 drop every 12 hours in both eyes.</li><li>Ask your pharmacist to suggest a brand. Examples are Zaditor or Alaway.</li><li>For severe allergies, using ketotifen eye drops every day will help the most. Use these eye drops until pollen season is over.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Older Antihistamine/Vasoconstrictor Eye Drops - 2nd Choice:</strong> <ul><li>Often, the eyes will feel much better after the allergic substance is washed out. Also, putting a cold wet washcloth on them usually makes the eyes feel better.</li><li>If not, this type of eye drop can be used for added relief. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Ask your pharmacist to suggest a brand. Examples are Naphcon A, Opcon A or Visine A. The A stands for antihistamine.</li><li>Avoid vasoconstrictor eyedrops without an allergy medicine in them. These are the eye drops without an A in the name, such as plain Visine. Reason: They only treat the redness, not the cause.</li><li>Dose: 1 drop every 8 hours as needed.</li><li>Do not use for over 5 days. (Reason: Will cause red eyes from rebound effect)</li><li>Downside: Doesn't work as well as Ketotifen eye drops.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Eye Drops - How to Give:</strong><ul><li>For a cooperative child, gently pull down on the lower lid. Put 1 drop inside the lower lid. Then ask your child to close the eye for 2 minutes. Reason: So the medicine will get into the tissues.</li><li>For a child who won't open his eye, have him lie down. Put 1 drop over the inner corner of the eye. If your child opens the eye or blinks, the eye drop will flow in. If he doesn't open the eye, the drop will slowly seep into the eye. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Contact Lenses: </strong><ul><li>Children who wear contact lenses need to switch to glasses for a while. </li><li>This will help the eye heal faster.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>If you know the cause of the allergy symptoms, try to avoid it. This is the case with animal allergies. The symptoms will not come back if there is no contact. </li><li>But, you can't avoid pollens because they are in the air. Most eye allergies continue through the pollen season. They can last 4 to 8 weeks.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return To School: </strong><ul><li>Children with pink eyes from an allergy do not need to miss any school.</li></ul></div>\n",

When the white of the eye becomes pink or red, it’s called pinkeye. Conjunctivitis is the medical name for pinkeye.  The conjunctiva is the membrane that covers the white of the eye.  It becomes pink when it is infected or irritated. Pinkeye (conjunctivitis) has many causes.</li><li><strong>Viral conjunctivitis</strong> is the main cause of pink eyes without pus. Most often, it is part of a cold.</li><li><strong>Bacterial conjunctivitis</strong>. Pinkeye plus the eyelids are stuck together with pus.  Most likely, this is a secondary infection of a viral conjunctivitis. </li><li><strong>Allergic conjunctivitis</strong> from pollens. Most children with eye allergies also have nasal allergies (hay fever). Symptoms include sneezing and clear nasal discharge.</li><li><strong>Irritant conjunctivitis</strong> from sunscreen, soap, chlorine in pool water, smoke, or smog. Irritants can also be transferred by touching the eye with dirty fingers. Irritants can be food or plant resins.</li><li><strong>Contact lens conjunctivitis. </strong>Caused by poor use of disinfecting solution or keeping lenses in overnight.</li><li><strong>Foreign body</strong> (FB). If only one side has pinkeye, a FB in the eye must be considered.</li><li><strong>Serious Cause.</strong> A bacterial infection of the eyelids and skin around them. Causes the lids to be very red and swollen.</li></ul>\n",

What happens will tell you if the cause is different.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Eye Cleansing:</strong> <ul><li>Cleanse eyelids with warm water and a clean cotton ball.</li><li>Try to do this 3 times a day while your child is awake and at home.</li><li>This usually will keep a bacterial infection from occurring.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Artificial Tears:</strong><ul><li>Artificial tears often make red eyes feel better. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Use 1 drop per eye 3 times a day as needed. Use them after cleansing the eyelids.</li><li>Antibiotic and vasoconstrictor eyedrops do not help viral eye infections.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Eye Drops: How to Give</strong><ul><li>For a cooperative child, gently pull down on the lower lid. Put 1 drop inside the lower lid. Then ask your child to close the eye for 2 minutes. Reason: So the medicine will get into the tissues.</li><li>For a child who won't open his eye, have him lie down. Put 1 drop over the inner corner of the eye. If your child opens the eye or blinks, the eye drop will flow in. If he doesn't open the eye, the drop will slowly seep into the eye.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Contact Lenses: </strong><ul><li>Children who wear contact lenses need to switch to glasses for a while.</li><li>Reason: To prevent damage to the cornea.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong> <ul><li>Pinkeye with a cold usually lasts about 7 days.</li><li>Sometimes, it turns into a bacterial eye infection. You can tell because the eyelids will become stuck together with pus.</li><li>Pinkeye from an irritant usually goes away within 2 hours after it's removed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return To School:</strong><ul><li>Pinkeye with watery discharge is harmless. There is a slight risk it could be passed to others.</li><li>Children with pink eyes from a cold do not need to miss any school.</li><li>Pinkeye is not a public health risk. Keeping these children home is over-reacting. If asked, tell the school your child is on eye drops (artificial tears).</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Fevers are temperatures 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.</strong></div><div><strong>Doctors and nurses don't always agree on when to treat fevers.</strong> Here are some general guidelines.</div><div><strong>Temperatures below 100.4 F (38 C) are normal.</strong>  They are not a fever. The body temperature normally goes up during the day and comes down during the night. Don't make the mistake of treating normal temps.</div><div><strong>Fevers only need to be treated if they cause discomfort</strong>. Most fevers don't cause any discomfort until they go above 104 F (40 C). Discomfort at a lower fever is probably due to some pain (such as from a sore throat).</div><div><strong>Fevers 100.4 to 102 F (38-39 C) are low grade fevers.</strong> Many doctors and nurses call them &quot;good fevers&quot;.</div><div><strong>Start medicines for fevers only if higher than 102 F (39 C).</strong> Remember that fevers are needed to fight the infection.</div><div><strong>Fever helps the body fight infections.</strong> It turns on the body's immune system. Fever is a defense response found in all animals. Fevers between 100 and 104 F actually help sick children get better.</div><div><strong>Treat fevers with one fever medicine</strong>. Use either acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen, in the correct dosage. Don't give both fever medicines together. Reason: it is not needed. Remember, fever is helping your child's body fight the infection. </div><div><strong>High fevers are 104 F (40 C) or higher.</strong> While we call them &quot;high&quot;, they are not harmful. </div><div><strong>With treatment, most fevers come down about 2 degrees F (about 1 degree C).</strong> They often don't come down to normal. That's fine. When the fever medicine wears off, expect the fever to go up again. That's also normal.</div><div><strong>Most fevers with infections stay below 104 F (40 C).</strong> Reason: the brain has a thermostat that keeps the body at the best temperature to fight the germs. They sometimes go to 105 F (40.6 C), but that temp is also harmless. The brain knows when the body is too hot.</div><div><strong>If your child's doctor tells you to treat fevers differently, follow their advice.</strong><br /></div><div><strong>Fevers from infections don't cause &quot;brain damage&quot;.</strong> Only fevers above 108° F (42°C) can cause brain damage. Temperatures that high are very rare. They are caused by human error. An example would be a child left in a closed car during hot weather.</div><div><strong>Seizures triggered by fever are uncommon.</strong> Only 4% of children can have a seizure from fever. While these seizures are scary to watch, most stop within 2 minutes. And they don't cause any permanent harm, such as learning problems or seizures without fever.</div><div><strong>Most fevers with viral infections last 2 or 3 days.</strong> The fever will go away and not return once the body overpowers the virus. Most often, this is day 3 or 4. When using fever medicines, expect the fever to keep coming back after the medicine wears off. That's normal.</div><div><strong>If your child is well and feels warm to touch, they probably don't have a fever.</strong> Children can feel warm for many reasons. Examples are playing hard, crying hard, getting out of a warm bed, or hot weather. They are &quot;giving off heat.&quot; Their skin temperature should return to normal within 20 minutes after exercise.</div><div><strong>If your child acts sick and feels warm to touch, they probably have a fever.</strong> If you want to be sure, take their temperature. But you don't need to keep taking it.</div><div><strong>Summary: Look at your child, not the thermometer.</strong> How your child looks is what's important. The exact temperature number is not. If your child looks or acts very sick, the cause is more likely to be serious. But the level of fever tells us very little. Viruses and bacteria can both cause high fevers. </div>\n",

Most often, this is from a ball. The energy is absorbed by the joint surface and the injury occurs there. For jammed fingers, always check that the fingertip can be fully straightened.</li><li><strong>Crushed or Smashed Fingertip</strong>. Most often, this is from a car door or a screen door. The end of the finger may get a few cuts or a blood blister. Sometimes, the nail can be damaged. Broken bones are not common with this kind of injury.</li><li><strong>Fingernail Injury.</strong> If the nailbed is cut, it needs sutures to prevent a deformed fingernail. </li><li><strong>Blood Clot under the Nail.</strong> Most often caused by a crush injury. This can be from a door crushing the finger. It can also be from a heavy object falling on the nailbed. Many are only mildly painful. Some are severely painful and throbbing.  These need the pressure under the nail released. This can relieve the pain and prevent loss of the fingernail.</li><li><strong>Fractures or Dislocations.</strong></li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></p><ul><li>The main symptom is pain.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention</strong></p><ul><li>Careful adult supervision of young children</li><li>Education of older children about high risk behaviors</li></ul>\n",

Press for 10 minutes.</li><li>Wash the wound with soap and water for 5 minutes.</li><li>For any dirt in the wound, wash gently.</li><li>For any cuts, use an antibiotic ointment such as Polysporin.

Use a pair of scissors that have been cleaned. Cut along the line of the tear. Reason: Pieces of nail taped in place will catch on objects.</li><li>Soak the finger for 20 minutes in cold water for pain relief.</li><li>Use an antibiotic ointment such as Polysporin. No prescription is needed. Then cover with a Band-Aid. Change daily.</li><li>After about 7 days, the nailbed should be covered by new skin. It should no longer hurt.

The intensity is far less than that of a bee sting.</li><li>Itching follows the pain and can last for weeks.</li><li>Hive-like bump occurs at sting site within 30 minutes (100%). This looks like a red spot with raised white center.</li><li>Pimples with yellow fluid (pustules) occur at the sting site within 24 hours (96%). These pustules are almost diagnostic for fire ant stings. They are very itchy. They usually open on their own by 3 days. Then, they dry over. Sometimes, they can last for up to a week.</li><li><strong>Swelling.</strong> Normal swelling from venom can increase for 24 hours after the sting. Stings of the upper face can cause severe swelling around the eye. This is harmless.</li><li><strong>Severe or Extreme Swelling.</strong> Sometimes, fire ant bites can cause severe swelling. Hand or foot bites can cause swelling that crosses the wrist (or ankle). The degree of swelling can interfere with function and require steroids. These do not carry an increased risk of allergic reaction with future stings.</li><li><strong>Redness.</strong> Stings can normally become red. That doesn't mean they are infected. Infections rarely occur in stings. </li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Cause</strong></p><ul><li>The sting involves injecting venom into the human from the fire ant's stinger.</li><li>A fire ant attaches to the skin with its jaws and swivels its body. It stings multiple times with its back stinger.</li><li>One fire ant can leave a semi-circular pattern of several stings.</li><li>Symptoms are all from the venom.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>General Information About Fire Ants</strong> </p><ul><li>In infested areas, fire ants cause many more stings than bees or yellow jackets.</li><li>Over 50% of people living in infested areas are stung each year.</li><li>Fire ants are found throughout the Southern U.S., from Florida to Texas. More recently, they have also appeared in California, New Mexico and Arizona.</li><li>Colonies of fire ants live in small mounds of dirt, usually 6 inches tall.</li><li>When the mound is disturbed, hundreds of fire ants stream out and attack.</li><li>The fire ant causes an immediate 'burning' sensation at the site of the stings. This is how it got its name.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Fire Ant Stings</strong> </p><ul><li>Avoidance of fire ants is the only way to prevent stings.</li><li>Teach your children to recognize their colonies (mounds) and to keep their distance.</li><li>Insect repellents (including those containing DEET) are not effective in preventing fire ant stings.</li><li>Wear socks. Fire ants cannot bite through socks.</li></ul>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Types of Foreskin Retraction Problems</strong></p><ul><li>The foreskin usually causes no problems. However, forceful retraction can cause it to get stuck behind the glans. The glans is the head of the penis. This can cause severe pain and swelling. This is called <strong>paraphimosis</strong>. It's a medical emergency.</li><li>If retraction is forceful, it can cause a small cut. This cut may cause a small amount of bleeding and pain.</li><li>Sometimes, the cut causes the space under the foreskin to become infected.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Phimosis (Tight Foreskin):</strong><ul><li>Phimosis means a tight foreskin. It means the foreskin can't be pulled back (retracted) over the head of the penis. It's a medical term.</li><li>All males are born with a tight foreskin (normal phimosis). In fact, at birth the inner layer of the foreskin is fused to the glans (head of the penis).</li><li>Separation occurs naturally over the years. Puberty accelerates the process.</li><li>Partial separation starts by 2 years of age.</li><li>By age 6, 90% of foreskins can be mostly or fully retracted.</li><li>By age 16, 99% can be fully retracted.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>At birth, the foreskin is attached to the head of the penis (glans). It is attached by a layer of cells.</li><li>Over time, the foreskin will separate from the head of the penis. This is a natural process and occurs over 5 to 10 years. It slowly loosens up (retracts) a little at a time.</li><li>Normal erections during childhood cause most of the change by stretching the foreskin.</li><li>If your boy has a normal urine stream, any foreskin movement is normal.</li><li>There should be no rush to achieve full retraction. This always occurs on its own by puberty.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Smegma:</strong><ul><li>Smegma is the small pieces of whitish material found under the foreskin.</li><li>Smegma is made up of dead skin cells. These cells are shed from the lining of the foreskin and the penis. It becomes trapped under the foreskin.</li><li>Smegma is normal and harmless. It is not a sign of an infection. It is produced in small amounts throughout life.</li><li>Smegma can build up under the foreskin. This happens if the foreskin is not pulled back and cleaned regularly.</li><li>Smegma also can occur before the foreskin becomes retractable. It looks like small white lumps. It lies under the foreskin that is still stuck to the penis head. It can't be removed at this stage.</li><li>If it lies beyond the level of foreskin retraction, it should be left alone. Wait until normal separation exposes it, then gently wipe it away.</li><li><strong>Caution.</strong> During the first year of life, do not make any attempts at foreskin retraction. Leave the smegma alone.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Cleansing Before Age 1 Year:</strong><ul><li>During the early years of life, only clean the outside of the foreskin.</li><li>Don't make any attempts at retraction.</li><li>Don't put any cotton swabs into the opening.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Foreskin Partial Retraction:</strong><ul><li>Begin gentle partial retraction at 1-3 years of age. Exception: Your child's doctor has recommended not retracting foreskin until a later age.</li><li>Frequency: It can be done once per week during bathing.</li><li>Gently pull the skin on the shaft of the penis backward towards the stomach.</li><li>This will make the foreskin open up. You will be able to see part of the glans (head of the penis).</li><li>Be gentle. Retraction should never cause pain or crying.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Cleansing After 1 - 3 Years Old:</strong><ul><li>As the foreskin becomes able to partially retract, cleanse beneath it. This helps to prevent infections.</li><li>Wash the exposed part of the glans gently with warm water. Then, dry it.</li><li>Do not use soap or leave soapy water under the foreskin. This can cause redness and swelling.</li><li>Wipe away any whitish material (smegma) that you find there.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Reposition the Foreskin:</strong> <ul><li>After cleansing, always pull the foreskin forward to its normal position.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Avoid Forceful Retraction:</strong><ul><li>This can cause bleeding or tears of the tissue.</li><li>It also may cause the foreskin to become stuck behind the penis head. </li><li>Retraction is too hard if it causes any pain or crying.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Teach Child How to Retract:</strong><ul><li>By age 5 or 6, teach your son to retract his own foreskin.</li><li>Teach him to clean beneath it once a week during bathing.</li><li>This will help to prevent poor hygiene and infection.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Pain Following Recent Attempt at Retraction:</strong><ul><li>The attempt to retract the foreskin has probably caused a small cut or tear. Raw surfaces are painful.</li><li>Cover the raw area with a layer of antibiotic ointment.</li><li>If you don't have one, use petroleum jelly.</li><li>Once the raw surface is protected from the air, the pain should go away. The pain should slowly improve over a few hours.</li><li>Continue twice a day until healed. This takes about 1 or 2 days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>The No Retraction Approach to the Foreskin:</strong><ul><li>Some doctors advise that a parent should never try to retract (pull back) the foreskin. The parent should never try to clean under the foreskin.</li><li>They teach that only the boy himself should ever retract his foreskin. They suggest teaching the boy to do this after puberty or about age 12.</li><li>They teach that the foreskin will naturally retract on its own during puberty. This is usually true.</li><li>The advice against parent retraction is more common in Europe.</li><li>It is a safe option and prevents any forceful or harmful retraction. </li><li>But, the gentle partial retraction for cleansing described with this advice is also safe.</li><li>Ask your child's doctor for their thoughts.</li></ul></div>\n",

It can be serious. It always needs medical care after re-warming.</li><li>Common sites are toes, fingers, tip of the nose, the outer ear or cheeks.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Frostbite Severity</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Frostnip</strong> (mild frostbite). Cold, tingling and painful skin. No skin changes after re-warming.</li><li><strong>1st Degree.</strong> White and waxy (hard) while frozen. Mild redness and swelling after re-warming. No blisters.</li><li><strong>2nd Degree.</strong> Same as 1st degree plus blisters after 24 hours.</li><li><strong>3rd Degree.</strong> Blood-filled blisters leading to skin damage and scarring.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Cause</strong></p><ul><li>The nerves, blood vessels and skin cells are frozen for a short time.</li><li><strong>Type of contact.</strong> Frostbite is made worse if the skin and clothing are wet. Touching bare hands to cold metal during freezing weather can cause frostbite right away.</li><li><strong>Time of contact.</strong> The longer the exposure, the greater the heat loss and the chance of frostbite. The wind-chill index also plays a part in how quickly frostbite occurs.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Frostbite</strong></p><ul><li>Cold sensitivity and recurrent frostbite is common following severe frostbite.</li><li>Dress in layers for cold weather. The first layer should be thermal underwear. The outer layer needs to be waterproof. The layers should be loose, not tight. Mittens are warmer than gloves. Do not use tight gloves or shoes. They might interfere with circulation.</li><li>Wear a hat, because over 50% of heat loss occurs from the head.</li><li>Change wet gloves or socks right away.</li><li>Teach your child to know the first warning signs of frostbite. Tingling and numbness are signs to go indoors.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>Frostbite means the nerves and skin were frozen for a short time.</li><li>Most frostbite is mild. Most often, it gets better with warming up.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Rewarming - Rewarm the skin fast with wet heat:</strong><ul><li>Move into a warm room.</li><li><strong>For Frostbite of Fingers or Toes.</strong> Place the body part in warm water. A bathtub or sink is often the best method. The water should be very warm (104° to 108° F, or 40° to 42° C). It should not be hot enough to burn. Keep soaking in the warm water for about 30 minutes. A pink flush means circulation has returned to the body part. At this point, the numbness should be gone.</li><li><strong>For Frostbite of the Face (such as ears, nose).</strong> Put a warm wet washcloth on the area. You should keep doing this for about 30 minutes. A pink flush means circulation has returned to the area.</li><li>With more severe frostbite, the last 10 minutes of rewarming can be painful.</li><li>If not using a tub, keep the rest of your child's body warm. Cover with blankets.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Common Treatment Mistakes:</strong><ul><li>A common mistake is to put snow on the frostbite or to rub it. Both can cause damage to thawing tissues.</li><li>Do not re-warm with dry heat. Do not use heat lamps, heating pads or electric heaters. Reason: Skin that has frostbite can't sense burning.</li><li>Do not re-warm if could freeze again in the next few hours. Freezing-warming-freezing causes more harm than freezing-warming.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Drink Warm Liquids:</strong><ul><li>Have your child drink lots of warm liquids such as hot chocolate.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ibuprofen:</strong><ul><li>For true frostbite, give ibuprofen for pain relief.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Aloe Vera Ointment:</strong><ul><li>Put aloe vera ointment on the frostbite.</li><li>Use twice daily for 5 days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Frostnip does not cause any damage to the skin. After rewarming, skin feeling, color and softness come back in less than 1 hour.</li><li>Mild frostbite: After rewarming, the skin may be flushed and tingly. This lasts for a few hours.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Types of Head Injuries</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Scalp Injury.</strong> Most head injuries only damage the scalp. Examples are a cut, scrape, bruise or swelling.  It is common for children to fall and hit their head while growing up.  This is especially common when a child is learning to walk. Big lumps (bruises) can occur with minor injuries. This is because there is a large blood supply to the scalp.  For the same reason, small cuts on the head may bleed a lot.  Bruises on the forehead sometimes cause black eyes 1 to 3 days later. This is caused by blood spreading downward by gravity. </li><li><strong>Skull Fracture.</strong> Only 1% to 2% of children with head injuries will get a skull fracture.  Most often, there are no other symptoms except for a headache. The headache occurs at the site where the head was hit.  Most skull fractures occur without any injury to the brain. They heal easily.</li><li><strong>Concussion.</strong> A concussion is a type of brain injury. It causes a temporary change in how the brain works. It is usually caused by a sudden blow or jolt to the head.  Most children bump or hit their heads without causing a concussion.  The most common signs are a brief period of confusion or memory loss. This happens after the injury. Other signs of a concussion can include a headache or vomiting. Dizziness, acting dazed, or being knocked out can also be signs.  A person does NOT need to be knocked out to have had a concussion. Following a concussion, some children have ongoing symptoms. These can include mild headaches, dizziness or thinking difficulties. School problems or emotional changes can occur. These symptoms can last for several weeks. </li><li><strong>Brain Injuries</strong> are uncommon, but are an emergency.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Symptoms of a Brain Injury</strong> </p><ul><li>Hard to wake up or keep awake OR</li><li>Acts or talks confused OR</li><li>Slurred speech OR</li><li>Weakness of arms or legs OR</li><li>Walking is not steady</li><li>Any of these symptoms are an emergency. If they happen, call 911.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Symptoms of a Minor Head Injury</strong></p><ul><li>The main symptom is pain.</li><li>The scalp may bleed a little or develop a lump.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention</strong></p><ul><li>Careful adult supervision of young children</li><li>Education of older children about high risk behaviors</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>Most head injuries only cause a swelling or bruise to the scalp. The main symptom is pain where the head was injured.</li><li>The skull bone protects the brain from getting injured.</li><li>Big lumps or bruising can occur with minor injuries to the scalp. This is normal. Reason: The scalp has a large blood supply.</li><li>Swelling of the scalp does not mean there is any swelling of the brain. The scalp and brain are not connected. They are separated by the skull bone.</li><li>The mildest brain injury is a concussion. Most of those also turn out fine.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Wound Care: </strong><ul><li>If there is a scrape or cut, wash it off with soap and water.</li><li>For any bleeding, put direct pressure on the wound. Use a gauze pad or clean cloth. Press for 10 minutes or until the bleeding has stopped.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Cold Pack:</strong><ul><li>Use a cold pack or ice bag wrapped in a wet cloth. Put it on any swelling. Do this for 20 minutes.</li><li>Reason: Prevent big lumps (&quot;goose eggs&quot;). Also, helps with the pain.</li><li>Repeat in 1 hour, then as needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Watch Your Child:</strong>  <ul><li>Watch your child closely during the first 2 hours after the injury.</li><li>Have your child lie down and rest until all symptoms have cleared. (Note: Mild headache, mild dizziness and nausea are common.)</li><li>Allow your child to sleep if he wants to, but keep him nearby.</li><li>Wake him up after 2 hours of sleeping. Check that he is alert and knows who you are. Also check that he can talk and walk normally.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Diet:</strong> <ul><li>Offer only clear fluids to drink, in case he vomits. Allow a regular diet after 2 hours.</li><li>Exception: Babies can continue breast feeding or formula. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Pain Medicine:</strong> <ul><li>To help with the pain, give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed.</li><li>Exception: Do not give until 2 hours have passed from injury without any vomiting.</li><li>Never give aspirin to children and teens. Reason: increases risk of bleeding.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Special Precautions for One Night:</strong><ul><li>Mainly, sleep in same room as your child for the first night.</li><li>Reason: If a problem occurs, you will recognize it if you are close by. Problems include a bad headache, vomiting or confusion. Also, look for any change in your child's normal behavior.</li><li>Option: If you are worried, wake your child once during the night. Check how he walks and talks.</li><li>After 24 hours, return to a normal sleep routine.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong> <ul><li>Most head trauma only causes an injury to the scalp.</li><li>The headache at the site of impact gets better in 2 to 3 days.</li><li>The swelling may take a week to go away.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Types of Heat Reactions</strong></p><ul><li>There are 3 main reactions to hot temperatures and heat waves.</li><li><strong>Heatstroke or Sunstroke.</strong> Symptoms include hot, flushed skin with high fever over 105° F (40.5° C). Over 50% of children with heatstroke do not sweat. Heatstroke can cause confusion, coma or shock. Heatstroke is a life-threatening emergency. Call 911.</li><li><strong>Heat Exhaustion.</strong> Symptoms include pale skin, profuse sweating and nausea. Dizziness, fainting, or weakness can also be signs. Can have a mild fever 100 - 102° F (37.8 - 39° C) for a short time. Most of the time, there is no fever. Most of these symptoms are caused by dehydration from sweating. A person can progress from heat exhaustion to heatstroke. So, all patients with severe symptoms (such as fainting) need to be seen now. Mild symptoms (such as dizziness) can be treated at home with fluids and rest. But, if these don't resolve with treatment, these children also need to be seen.</li><li><strong>Heat Cramps.</strong> Severe muscle cramps in the legs (calf or thigh muscles) and stomach are present. No fever. Tightness or spasms of the hands may occur. After your child drinks fluids and cools down, he or she will feel better. All symptoms should go away in a few hours.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Causes</strong></p><ul><li>All 3 reactions are caused by exposure to high temperatures often with high humidity.</li><li><strong>Exertion.</strong> During hot weather, hard work or sports can cause heat production to exceed heat loss.</li><li><strong>Dehydration.</strong> Poor hydration interferes with sweating. That increases the risk of heat reactions. </li><li><strong>Babies</strong> are at more risk because they are less able to sweat when hot.</li><li><strong>Heat waves.</strong> The first heat wave of the summer can cause heat problems. It takes 8 to 10 days for you to become used to high summer temperatures. This can also happen on vacations. </li><li><strong>Exposure to a very high temperature.</strong> It usually follows exposure to a very high temperature. Examples are being inside a hot car or in a steam tent. Being indoors without air-conditioning during heat waves is also the main cause of heat stroke in the elderly. </li><li><strong>Health and risk factors.</strong> Babies are less able to sweat when hot. Obese children also have a decreased ability to give off heat.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention Of Heat Reactions</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Drink more water.</strong> When working or exercising in hot weather, have your child drink large amounts of cool water. This helps to prevent dehydration. For teens, this means at least 8 ounces (240 ml) every 15 to 30 minutes. Water is the ideal liquid for replacing lost sweat. Very little salt is lost.</li><li><strong>Sports drinks.</strong> Most often, special sports drinks offer no advantage over water. But, they are helpful if working out for longer than an hour. If that is the case, replace 1 water drink per hour with a sports drink.</li><li><strong>Take water breaks. </strong>Try to do this every 15 minutes in the shade. Drink some water even if you are not thirsty. Thirst can be delayed until a person is almost dehydrated.</li><li><strong>Avoid salt tablets.</strong> They slow down stomach emptying and delay the absorption of fluids.</li><li><strong>Dress cool. </strong>Wear a single layer of lightweight clothing. Change it if it becomes wet with sweat. Children need the same layers of clothing as an adult. Be extra careful of babies in hot weather. Do not overdress them. </li><li><strong>Exercise smart.</strong> Physical activity in hot weather should be increased slowly.</li><li><strong>Stay cool. </strong>During heat waves, spend as much time as possible inside with air-conditioning. Electric fans also help. Slow down. It takes at least a week to get used to hot summer temperatures.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Drink Lots of Fluids:</strong><ul><li>All the symptoms of heat reactions respond to fluid replacement. Give your child as much cold water as he will drink. Do this until he feels better.</li><li>If you have a sports drink (such as Gatorade), give it instead. Sports drinks contain water, salt and sugar.</li><li>How Much (Teens): Start with 3 cups (24 ounces or 720 ml). Then give 1 cup (240 ml) every 15 minutes for the next 1-2 hours.</li><li>Preteens (6-12): Start with 2 cups (16 ounces or 480 ml). Then give 6 ounces (180 ml) every 15 minutes for the next 1-2 hours.</li><li>The urine color can tell if drinking enough fluids. Dark yellow urine means mild dehydration. Clear or light yellow urine means your child is drinking enough fluids.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Heat Cramps:</strong> <ul><li>Heat cramps are the most common reaction to heat exposure.

Antibiotic drugs are not needed.</li><li><strong>Laceration (cut).</strong> A wound that goes through the skin to the fat or muscle tissue. Some chance of infection. Most need to be seen. Cleaning the wound can help prevent this. Antibiotic drugs may be needed.</li><li><strong>Wound Infection.</strong> Any redness (regardless of size) that starts 24-96 hours later suggests an infection. Human bites are more likely to become infected than animal bites.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></p><ul><li>The main symptom is pain.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Causes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clenched Fist Injury.</strong> &quot;Fight bites&quot; occur during fist fights, usually in teen boys. The knuckle becomes cut when it strikes a tooth. The wound happens from punching someone in the mouth with a clenched fist. There is little skin protection over the knuckle joint. Mouth bacteria can be pushed into the joint and/or tendon sheath. Severe joint and tendon infections can result.</li><li><strong>Occlusive Fight Bites.</strong> Deliberate bites of a finger, arm, ear, etc. during a fight. High risk of infection, especially bites of the hand.</li><li><strong>Love Bites.</strong> Teens can leave bite marks on the neck or other sites. These &quot;love bites&quot; are a show of affection. Appear as a circle of tooth marks, usually with a clear center. These wounds are usually mild. They don't go through the top layer of the skin. Low risk of infection.</li><li><strong>Toddler Bites.</strong> Most toddler bites are safe because they don't break the skin. They usually leave red marks or sometimes bruise marks of individual teeth. Some cause a small scrape.</li></ul>\n",

Reason: they need to be cleaned with saline to prevent infection. </li><li>Minor scratches are safe to treat at home.

If it didn't break the skin, it can't become infected.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Clean the Wound:</strong> <ul><li>Wash all wounds right away with soap and water for 5 minutes.</li><li>Then, flush well under running water for a few minutes. Reason: Can prevent many wound infections.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Antibiotic Ointment:  </strong><ul><li>For any open cuts, buy an antibiotic ointment (no prescription needed).</li><li>Put it on the cut 3 times per day for 3 days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Treating Bruises:</strong> <ul><li><strong>Cold Pack:</strong> For bruising, use a cold pack. You can also use ice wrapped in a wet cloth. Apply it to the bruise for 20 minutes. Repeat in 1 hour, then as needed for the first 48 hours. Reason: Helps with bleeding, pain and swelling.</li><li><strong>Heat Pack:</strong> After 48 hours, put heat on the bruise. Use a heat pack, heating pad or warm wet washcloth.

But, biting can quickly become a bad habit and make your child very unpopular. So quickly get rid of it by using the tips below:</li><li>Establish a rule. &quot;'We never bite people because biting hurts.&quot; Tell your child that if he wants something he should come to you. He needs to ask for help or point to it.</li><li>Stop biting with a sharp 'No.' Be sure to use an unfriendly voice. Look your child straight in the eye. Try to stop them when they look as if  they might bite someone. Do this before they actually do it.   </li><li>Give your child a time-out. Send them to a boring place for about one minute per year of age. If time-out does not work, take away a favorite toy. Do this for the rest of the day.</li><li>Never bite your child back. Reason: You will only teach your child that it's okay to bite if you're bigger. If your child is aggressive, be sure to avoid any physical punishment like spanking. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Biting at Child Care - How to Stop:</strong> <ul><li>Biting behavior among a group of toddlers is common in child care settings. Up to 50% of children are bitten there at some point.</li><li>In general, biting is physically harmless since most bites by younger children don't puncture the skin. Infections are rare. Biting must be stopped, however, because it causes fear among the other children.</li><li>Many toddlers need help learning to control their aggressive behaviors. The biter should not be expelled from child care, because he can be helped.</li><li>The child care staff should provide careful supervision of the biter. They should quickly place the biting child in time-out. Do this even when he acts like he might bite someone. The problem should be dealt with right away by the person who sees it.</li></ul></div>\n",

Ask your child for some ideas.</li></ul></div><div><strong>A Positive Relationship Is Essential For Incentives To Work:</strong> <ul><li>Your child has to feel loved. Incentives will not work if you show anger.</li><li>Give lots of hugs and kisses to let your child know he is loved. This works better than words or praise.</li><li>Activities with you are also important. Examples are playing board games or playing catch. Reading, going to the park or on walks are other ideas.</li><li>Building a strong relationship with you is essential for your child's emotional well-being. It also makes your child more willing to follow your rules and requests.</li></ul></div>\n",

Reason: You would need to take the medicine every day for months.</li></ul></div><div><strong>HIGH-RISK Children for Complications From Influenza May Need Antiviral Drug:</strong><ul><li>Children are considered HIGH-RISK for complications if they have any of the following:</li><li>Lung disease (such as asthma)</li><li>Heart disease (such as a congenital heart disease)</li><li>Cancer or weak immune system conditions</li><li>Neuromuscular disease (such as muscular dystrophy)</li><li>Diabetes, sickle cell disease, kidney disease OR liver disease</li><li>Down's syndrome</li><li>Diseases requiring long-term aspirin therapy</li><li>Pregnancy</li><li>Severe obesity (BMI over 40)</li><li>All healthy children under 2 years old are also considered HIGH-RISK (CDC)</li><li>Note: All other children are referred to as LOW-RISK</li></ul></div><div><strong>Flu Shot - Best Protection:</strong><ul><li>Getting a flu shot is the best way to protect your family from flu.</li><li>Influenza vaccines are strongly advised for all children over 6 months of age. (AAP)</li><li>Adults should also get the shot.</li><li>The flu shot most often prevents the disease.</li><li>Even if your child gets the flu, the shot helps to reduce the symptoms.</li><li>A new flu shot is needed every year. Reason: Flu viruses keep changing.</li><li>After the flu shot, it takes 2 weeks to get full protection. But then, the protection lasts for the entire flu season. By contrast, an antiviral medicine only protects from flu while you are taking it.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Preventing Influenza With Antiviral Drug (such as Tamiflu):</strong><ul><li>The drug Tamiflu may help prevent flu after close contact.</li><li>But, it is only advised for some HIGH-RISK patients (CDC). See the HIGH-RISK list.</li><li>Most doctors wait until flu symptoms start before treating. Reasons: Even after close contact, some children don't get flu. Also, Tamiflu is helpful only while your child is taking it. It won't prevent flu once your child stops taking it.</li><li>The CDC also recommends early treatment if flu symptoms occur, not preventive treatment.</li><li>If your child is High Risk, call your doctor within 24 hours of exposure. Your doctor will decide if an antiviral drug is needed. For example: a High Risk child living in home with person who has proven influenza illness. They usually receive Tamiflu for prevention. </li><li>HIGH-RISK adults with recent close contact should also call their doctor. The HIGH-RISK adult group includes chronic disease, pregnant, or over 65.</li></ul></div><div><strong> How to Protect Yourself From Getting Sick:</strong><ul><li>Wash hands often with soap and water.</li><li>Alcohol-based hand cleaners work very well.</li><li>Avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth. Germs on the hands can spread this way.</li><li>Try to avoid close contact with sick people.</li><li>Avoid ERs and urgent care clinics if you don't need to go. These are places where you are more likely to be exposed to flu.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>Flu symptoms include cough, sore throat, runny nose, and fever. During influenza season, if your child has these symptoms, he probably has the flu.</li><li>For healthy people, the symptoms of influenza are like those of a common cold.</li><li>With flu, however, the onset is more abrupt. Also, the symptoms can be more severe.</li><li>The treatment of influenza depends on your child's main symptoms. It is no different from the treatment of the same symptoms with a cold.</li><li>If your doctor has prescribed an antiviral drug, take it as directed.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>For a Runny Nose With Lots of Discharge: Blow or Suction the Nose</strong><ul><li>The nasal mucus and discharge is washing germs out of the nose and sinuses.</li><li>Blowing the nose is all that's needed.</li><li>Teach your child how to blow the nose at age 2 or 3.</li><li>For younger children, gently suction the nose with a suction bulb.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Nasal Saline To Open a Blocked Nose:</strong><ul><li>Use saline (salt water) nose drops or spray to loosen up the dried mucus. If you don't have saline, you can use a few drops of bottled water or clean tap water. (If under 1 year old, use bottled water or boiled tap water.)</li><li>STEP 1: Put 3 drops in each nostril. (If age under 1 year old, use 1 drop. Also, do 1 side at a time.)</li><li>STEP 2: Blow (or suction) each nostril out while closing off the other nostril.</li><li>STEP 3: Repeat nose drops and blowing (or suctioning) until the discharge is clear.</li><li>How often: Do nasal saline when your child can't breathe through the nose.</li><li>Saline nose drops or spray can be bought in any drugstore. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Saline nose drops can also be made at home. Use 1/2 teaspoon (2 ml) of table salt. Stir the salt into 1 cup (8 ounces or 240 ml) of water. You must use bottled or boiled water for this purpose.</li><li>Reason for nose drops: Suction or blowing alone can't remove dried or sticky mucus. Also, babies can't nurse or drink from a bottle unless the nose is open.</li><li>Other option. Use a warm shower to loosen mucus. Breathe in moist air, then blow each nostril.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Homemade Cough Medicines:</strong><ul><li>Goal: Decrease the irritation or tickle in the throat that causes a dry cough.</li><li>AGE 3 months to 1 year: Give warm clear fluids to treat the cough. Examples are warm apple juice and lemonade. Amount: Use a dose of 1-3 teaspoons (5-15 ml). Give 4 times per day when coughing. Caution: Do not use honey until 1 year old.</li><li>AGE 1 year and older: Use HONEY ½ teaspoon (2 ml) as needed. It's the best homemade cough medicine. It can thin the secretions and loosen the cough. If you don't have any honey, you can use corn syrup.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Sore Throat Pain Relief:</strong><ul><li>Can sip warm fluids such as chicken broth or apple juice.</li><li>Some children prefer cold foods such as popsicles or ice cream. </li><li>Give pain medicine (such as Tylenol) as needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Medicines for Flu Symptoms:</strong><ul><li><strong>Cold Medicines.</strong> Don't give any non-prescription cold or cough medicines to young children. They are not approved by the FDA under 6 years. Reasons: They are not safe and can cause serious side effects. Also, they are not helpful. They can't remove dried mucus from the nose. Nasal saline works best.</li><li><strong>Antibiotics Not Needed</strong>. Antibiotics are not helpful for flu or other viruses. Antibiotics may be used if your child gets an ear or sinus infection.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Fluids:</strong><ul><li>Try to get your child to drink lots of fluids.</li><li>Goal: Keep your child well hydrated.</li><li>It will thin out the mucus discharge from the nose. Also, it loosens up any phlegm in the lungs. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Fever:</strong><ul><li>For fevers above 102° F (39° C), give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Note: lower fevers are important for fighting infections.</li><li>AVOID ASPIRIN because of the strong link with Reye syndrome.</li><li>For ALL fevers: Keep your child well hydrated. Give lots of cold fluids.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Pain Medicine:</strong> <ul><li>For muscle aches or headaches, give acetaminophen (Tylenol) OR ibuprofen. Use as needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Avoid Tobacco Smoke:</strong> <ul><li>Tobacco smoke makes coughs much worse.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Influenza causes a cough that lasts 2 to 3 weeks. Your child will cough up lots of phlegm (mucus). The mucus can be gray, yellow or green. This is normal.</li><li>Coughing up mucus is very important. It helps protect the lungs from pneumonia.</li><li>We want to help a productive cough, not turn it off.</li><li>The fever lasts 2 to 3 days.</li><li>The runny nose lasts 7 to 14 days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return to School:</strong><ul><li>Spread is rapid, and the virus is easily passed to others.</li><li>The time it takes to get the flu after contact is about 2 days.</li><li>Your child can return to school after the fever is gone for 24 hours.</li><li>Your child should feel well enough to join in normal activities.</li></ul></div>\n",

This is common in younger children.</li><li>Bites can be itchy, painful or both.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Types of Insect Bites</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Itchy Insect Bites.</strong> Bites of mosquitoes, chiggers (harvest mites), fleas, and bedbugs usually cause itchy, red bumps.</li><li><strong>Painful Insect Bites.</strong> Bites of horseflies, deer flies, and gnats usually cause a painful, red bump. Fire ants, harvester ants, blister beetles, and centipedes also cause a painful, red bump. Within a few hours, fire ant bites can change to blisters or pimples.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Cause</strong></p><ul><li>When an insect bites, its secretions are injected into the skin.</li><li>The red bumps are the body's reaction to the secretions.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Insect Bites</strong></p><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>1. General Tips:</strong></p><ul><li>Wear long pants, a long-sleeved shirt and a hat.</li><li>Avoid being outside when the bugs are most active. Many insects that cause itchy bites are most active at sunrise or sunset. Examples are chiggers, no-see-ums, and mosquitoes.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>2. DEET Products: Use on the skin.</strong></p><ul><li>DEET is a very effective bug repellent. It also repels ticks and other insects.</li><li>The AAP approves DEET use over 2 months of age. Use 30% DEET or less. Use 30% DEET if you need 6 hours of protection. Use 10% DEET if you only need protection for 2 hours. (AAP 2003).</li><li>Don't put DEET on hands if your child sucks on their thumb or fingers. (Reason: prevent swallowing DEET.)</li><li>Warn older children who apply their own DEET to use less. A total of 3 or 4 drops can protect the whole body.</li><li>Put it on exposed areas of skin. Do not use near the eyes or mouth. Do not use on skin that is covered by clothing. Don't put DEET on sunburns or rashes. Reason: DEET can be easily absorbed in these areas.</li><li>Wash it off with soap and water when your child comes indoors.</li><li>Caution: DEET can damage clothing made of man-made fibers. It can also damage plastics (such as eye glasses) and leather. DEET can be used on cotton clothing.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>3. Permethrin Products: Use on clothing.</strong></p><ul><li>Products that contain permethrin work well to repel insects and ticks. Examples of these products are Duranon or Permanone.</li><li>Unlike DEET, these products are put on clothing instead of skin.</li><li>Put it on shirt cuffs, pant cuffs, shoes and hats.</li><li>You can also use it on other outdoor items (mosquito screens, sleeping bags).</li><li>Do not put permethrin on the skin. Reason: Sweat changes it so it does not work.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>Most insect bites cause a red bump. Some are larger (like a hive). Some have a small water blister in the center.

No prescription is needed. Put it on 3 times a day until the itch is gone. If you don't have, use a baking soda paste until you can get some.</li><li>If neither is available, use ice in a wet washcloth for 20 minutes.</li><li>Also, you can put firm, sharp, direct, steady pressure on the bite. Do this for 10 seconds to reduce the itch. A fingernail, pen cap, or other object can be used.</li><li><strong>Allergy Medicine.</strong> If the bite is still itchy, try an allergy medicine by mouth. Benadryl is a good one. No prescription is needed. Sometimes it helps, especially in allergic children.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Painful Insect Bites:</strong><ul><li>Soak a cotton ball in a baking soda solution. Rub the bite with it for 15 to 20 minutes. Do this once. This will usually reduce the pain.</li><li>You can also use an ice cube in a wet washcloth for 20 minutes.</li><li>To help with the pain, give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed.</li><li>For painful bites, allergy medicines don't help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Antibiotic Ointment:</strong><ul><li>If the bite has a scab and looks infected, use an antibiotic ointment. An example is Polysporin. No prescription is needed. Use 3 times per day. (Note: Usually impetigo is caused by scratching bites with dirty fingers).</li><li>Cover the scab with a Band-Aid to prevent scratching and spread.</li><li>Wash the sore and use the antibiotic ointment 3 times per day. Do this until healed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Most insect bites are itchy for several days.</li><li>Any pinkness or redness usually lasts 3 days.</li><li>The swelling may last 7 days.</li><li>Insect bites of the upper face can cause severe swelling around the eye. This is harmless.</li><li>The swelling is usually worse in the morning after lying down all night. It will improve after standing for a few hours.</li></ul></div>\n",

Most often, this is a pollen.</li><li>Grass, trees, weeds and molds are the most common pollens.</li><li>Allergens can also be from cats, dogs, horses, rabbits and other animals.</li><li>Dust, chemicals, or pollutants can also cause a raspy voice. This is from irritation of the vocal cords, not an allergic reaction.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention - How to Reduce the Pollen Your Child Breathes:</strong></p><ul><li>Pollen is carried in the air.</li><li>Keep windows closed in the home, at least in your child's bedroom.</li><li>Keep windows closed in car. Turn the air conditioner on recirculate.</li><li>Avoid window fans or attic fans. They pull in pollen.</li><li>Try to stay indoors on windy days. Reason: The pollen count is much higher when it's dry and windy.</li><li>Avoid playing with the outdoor dog.

No prescription is needed.

They are long-acting and last up to 24 hours.</li><li>AGE 2- 6 years old, give 2.5 mg (2.5 ml or 1/2 teaspoon) of liquid syrup. Use once daily in the morning.</li><li>AGE 6-12 years old, give 5 mg chewable tablet once daily in morning.</li><li>AGE: 12 years and older, give 10 mg tablet once daily in morning.</li><li>Downside: Doesn't control allergy symptoms as well as older allergy medicines. Also, sometimes will have breakthrough symptoms before 24 hours. If that happens, you can give a single dose of Benadryl or CTM.</li><li>Cost: Ask the pharmacist for a store brand. Reason: Costs less than the brand names.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Warm Liquids:</strong><ul><li>Age over 1 year. Can sip warm fluids such as chicken broth or apple juice.</li><li>Age over 6 years. Can also suck on cough drops or hard candy. Butterscotch seems to help.</li><li>Age over 8 years. Can also gargle. Use warm water with a little table salt added. A liquid antacid can be added instead of salt. Use Mylanta or the store brand. No prescription is needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Rest the Voice:</strong><ul><li>Avoid yelling and screaming. (Reason: causes vocal cord strain.)</li><li>Have your child try to talk as little as possible. He or she can also write notes for a few days.</li><li>Also, avoid clearing the throat. (Reason: Can make hoarseness worse.)</li></ul></div><div><strong>Avoid Tobacco Smoke:</strong><ul><li>Tobacco smoke makes hoarseness and coughs much worse.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Wash Pollen Off Body:</strong><ul><li>Remove pollen from the hair and skin with shampoo and a shower. This is really important before bedtime.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect</strong>:<ul><li>Hoarseness from an allergic substance that can be avoided should go away in hours. Examples are a reaction to pets, a barn, raking leaves or air pollution.</li><li>Hoarseness during pollen season can last 4-8 weeks. It may return whenever you don't give the allergy medicine. It can flare-up whenever the pollen count goes high.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return to School:</strong><ul><li>Your child does not need to miss any school for allergies.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Causes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Main Causes.</strong> Muscle spasms (cramps) and strained muscles (overuse) account for most leg pain.</li><li><strong>Muscle Cramps.</strong> Brief pains (1 to 15 minutes) are often due to muscle spasms (cramps).  Foot or calf muscles are especially prone to cramps that occur during sports. Foot or leg cramps may also awaken your child from sleep. Muscle cramps that occur during hard work or sports are called heat cramps.  They often respond to extra fluids and salt.</li><li><strong>Muscle Overuse (Strained Muscles).</strong> Constant leg pains are often from hard work or sports. Examples are running or jumping too much. This type of pain can last several hours or up to 7 days. Muscle pain can also be from a forgotten injury that occurred the day before.</li><li><strong>Growing Pains.</strong> 10% of healthy children have harmless leg pains that come and go. These are often called growing pains (although they have nothing to do with growth). Growing pains usually occur in the calf or thigh muscles.  They usually occur on both sides, not one side.  They occur late in the day. Most likely, they are due to running or playing hard.  They usually last 10 to 30 minutes.</li><li><strong>Calcium Deficiency.</strong> Calcium and Vitamin D deficiency can cause low grade bone pains. Pain is mainly in the legs and ribs. Children on a milk free diet are at risk. </li><li><strong>Viral Infections.</strong> Muscle aches in both legs are common with viral illness, especially influenza.</li><li><strong>Serious Causes.</strong> Fractures, deep vein thrombosis, neuritis (nerve infection) and arthritis (joint infection). Septic arthritis (a bacterial infection of any joint space) is a medical emergency.  The symptoms are severe joint pain, joint stiffness and a high fever.  Toxic synovitis of the hip is a harmless condition. It can imitate a septic arthritis of the hip.  The symptoms are a limp, moderate pain and usually no fever.  Toxic synovitis tends to occur in toddlers after jumping too much.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Pain Scale</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Mild:</strong> Your child feels pain and tells you about it. But, the pain does not keep your child from any normal activities. School, play and sleep are not changed.</li><li><strong>Moderate:</strong> The pain keeps your child from doing some normal activities.  It may wake him or her up from sleep.</li><li><strong>Severe:</strong> The pain is very bad. It keeps your child from doing all normal activities.</li></ul>\n",

You can also use ice wrapped in a wet cloth. Put it on the sore muscle for 20 minutes.</li><li><strong>Water.</strong> Heat cramps can occur with hard sports on a hot day.

Repeat 4 times on the first day, then as needed. Caution: Avoid frostbite.</li><li><strong>Heat Pack:</strong> If pain lasts over 2 days, put heat on the sore muscle. Use a heat pack, heating pad or warm wet washcloth. Do this for 10 minutes, then as needed. Caution: Avoid burns. For stiffness all over, use a hot bath instead. Move the sore leg muscles under the warm water.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Treatment for Growing Pains:</strong><ul><li>Most often, the pains are mild and don't last long. No treatment is needed.</li><li><strong>Massage.</strong> Rub the sore muscles to help the pain go away.</li><li><strong>Pain Medicine.</strong> If the pain lasts more than 30 minutes, give a pain medicine. You can use either acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed.</li><li><strong>Prevention.</strong> Research has shown that daily stretching can prevent most growing pains. Stretch the quads, hamstrings and calf muscles. Also, be sure your child gets enough calcium and Vitamin D in their diet.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect: </strong><ul><li>Muscle cramps usually last 5 to 30 minutes. </li><li>Once they go away, the muscle returns to normal quickly. </li><li>A strained muscle hurts for 3 to 7 days.

Sleepovers and bed-sharing are a major source.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Spread to Others</strong></p><ul><li>Avoid close contact with others until after the first anti-lice treatment.</li><li>Lice that are off the body rarely cause infection. Reason: Lice can't live for over 24 hours off the human body. Vacuum your child's room.</li><li>Soak hair brushes for 1 hour in a solution containing some anti-lice shampoo.</li><li>Wash your child's sheets, blankets, and pillow cases. Wash any clothes worn in the past 2 days. Wash in hot water (130° F or 54° C). This kills lice and nits.</li><li>Items that can't be washed (hats, coats, or scarves) can be set aside. Put them in sealed plastic bags for 2 weeks. This is the longest period that nits can survive. (Note: This step probably is not needed.)</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Lice Exposure: Low Risk for Getting It</strong></p><ul><li>Most children who are exposed to someone with head lice do not get them.</li><li>Lice cannot jump or fly. They can only crawl.</li><li>Lice are only transmitted by close head-to-head contact. Even then the risk is low.</li><li>Lice are rarely if ever transmitted by sharing caps or combs.</li><li>Sleeping together has a small risk of transmitting risk.</li><li>This is the only situation that the AAP recommends treating after exposure.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>Head lice can be treated at home.</li><li>With careful treatment, all lice and nits (lice eggs) are usually killed.</li><li>There are no lasting problems from having head lice.</li><li>They do not carry any diseases.</li><li>They do not make your child feel sick.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Anti-Lice Shampoo (such as Nix):</strong><ul><li>Buy Nix anti-lice creme rinse (no prescription needed) and follow package directions.</li><li>First, wash the hair with a regular shampoo. Then, towel dry it before using the anti-lice creme. Do NOT use a conditioner with this shampoo. Reason: It will interfere with Nix.</li><li>Pour 2 ounces (full bottle or 60 ml) of Nix into damp hair. People with long hair may need to use 2 bottles.</li><li>Work the Nix creme into all the hair down to the roots.</li><li>If needed, add a little warm water to work up a lather.</li><li>Nix is safe above 2 months old.</li><li>Leave the shampoo on for a full 10 minutes. If you don't, it won't kill all the lice. Then rinse the hair well with water and dry it with a towel.</li><li>REPEAT the anti-lice shampoo in 9 days. Two treatments are always needed. The second treatment will kill any new lice that have hatched from eggs.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Remove the Dead Nits (Not Urgent Or Essential):</strong><ul><li>Nit removal is not necessary. It should not interfere with the return to school.</li><li>Some schools, however, have a no-nit policy. They will not allow children to return if nits are seen. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that no-nit policies be no longer used. The National Association of School Nurses also takes this stand. If your child's school has a no-nit policy, call your child's doctor.</li><li>Reason: Only live lice can spread lice to another child. One treatment with Nix kills all the lice.</li><li>Nits (lice eggs) do not spread lice. Most treated nits (lice eggs) are dead after the first treatment with Nix. The others will be killed with the 2nd treatment.</li><li>Removing the dead nits is not essential nor urgent. However, it prevents others from thinking your child still has untreated lice.</li><li>Nits can be removed by backcombing with a special nit comb.</li><li>You can also pull them out one at a time. This will take a lot of time.</li><li>Wetting the hair with water makes removal easier. Avoid any products that claim they loosen the nits. (Reason: Can interfere with Nix)</li></ul></div><div><strong>Hairwashing Precautions to Help Nix Work:</strong><ul><li>Don't wash the hair with shampoo until 2 days after Nix treatment.</li><li>Avoid hair conditioners before treatment. Do not use them for 2 weeks after treatment. Reason: Coats the hair and interferes with Nix.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Cetaphil Cleanser for Nix Treatment Failures:</strong><ul><li>Go to your drugstore and buy Cetaphil cleanser in the soap department. No prescription is needed. It works by coating the lice and suffocating them.</li><li>Apply the Cetaphil cleanser throughout the scalp to dry hair.</li><li>After all the hair is wet, wait 2 minutes for Cetaphil to soak in.</li><li>Comb out as much excess cleanser as possible.</li><li>Blow dry your child's hair. It has to be thoroughly dry down to the scalp to suffocate the lice. Expect this to take 3 times longer than normal drying.</li><li>The dried Cetaphil will smother the lice. Leave it on your child's hair for at least 8 hours.</li><li>In the morning, wash off the Cetaphil with a regular shampoo.</li><li>To cure your child of lice, REPEAT this process twice in 1 and 2 weeks.</li><li>The cure rate can be 97%.</li><li>Detailed instructions can be found online: <a href=\"http://www.nuvoforheadlice.com\">www.nuvoforheadlice.com</a></li></ul></div><div><strong>Treating Close Contacts:</strong><ul><li>Check the heads of everyone else living in your home. If lice or nits are seen, they also should be treated. Use the anti-lice shampoo on them as well. </li><li>Also, anyone with an itchy scalp rash should be treated.</li><li>Bedmates of children with lice should also be treated. If in doubt, have your child checked for lice.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>With 2 treatments, all lice and nits should be killed.</li><li>If lice come back, usually the product wasn't used correctly.  It can be that the shampoo wasn't left on for 10 minutes. It may also mean that hair conditioner was used. It can also mean another contact with an infected person.</li><li>Make sure the Nix is repeated in 9 days. If you don't, the lice may come back.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return to School:</strong><ul><li>Your child can return to school after 1 treatment with the anti-lice shampoo. </li><li>A child with nits doesn't need to miss any school or child care. Nits do not spread to others, nor do they cause lice in others.</li><li>Remind your child not to share combs and hats.</li><li>Be sure to tell the school nurse or child care center director. She can check other students in your child's class.</li></ul></div>\n",

Juices or smoothies are good. It's always harder to swallow pills with water.</li><li>Place the pill or capsule far back on the tongue. Then have your child fill the mouth with fluid. Have your child try to swallow large gulps at a time. The pill will disappear from the mouth.</li><li>Keep the head in a neutral or slightly bent forward position. It's difficult to swallow if the head is bent backward.</li><li>Drinking quickly through a straw can also help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Split or Crush Pills:</strong><ul><li>For easier swallowing, one approach is to split the pill into halves or quarters.</li><li>Another approach is to convert the pill to a powder. Crush the pill between two spoons. Crushing is made easier by wetting the pill with a few drops of water. Let it soften for 5 minutes.</li><li>Mix the crushed pill with a pancake syrup, chocolate syrup, or yogurt. You can also use any sweet food that doesn't require any chewing.</li><li>Note: You can do this with most pills. However, don't do this with slow-release or enteric-coated pills. Check with your doctor if you are unsure what you can do. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Capsules:</strong><ul><li>Slow-release capsules can be emptied. Just make sure the contents are swallowed without chewing.</li><li>These capsules often contain medicines with a bitter taste. So, the contents need to be mixed with a sweet food. Applesauce or yogurt may work.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Prevention Through Practice:</strong><ul><li>If your child is over age 8 and unable to swallow pills, he should practice. Practice this skill when he's not sick or cranky. (Note: Some children can't swallow pills until age 10.)</li><li>Start with small pieces of candy or ice and progress to M&amp;M's. Try to use substances that will melt quickly if they get stuck. If necessary, coat them with butter first.</li><li>Once candy pellets are mastered, pills can often be managed as well.</li></ul></div>\n",

You can also run your finger inside the cheek and push down on the lower jaw.</li><li>Insert the syringe between the teeth. Drip the medicine onto the back of the tongue.</li><li>Keep the mouth closed until your child swallows. Gravity can help if you have your child in an upright position. Caution: Swallowing cannot occur if the head is bent backward.</li><li>Afterward, say: &quot;I'm sorry we had to hold you. If you help next time, we won't have to.&quot;</li><li>Always give your child a hug. If your child was somewhat cooperative, also give them a reward.</li></ul></div>\n",

Often, the bite looks like hives.</li><li>Most of the time, the bumps are less than 1/2 inch (12 mm) in size. In young children, they can be larger.</li><li>Some even have a small water blister in the center.</li><li>Suspect mosquito bites if there are bites on other parts of the body. Most bites occur on exposed parts such as face and arms.</li><li>Bites of the upper face can cause severe swelling around the eye or ear. This can last for several days.</li><li>In young children (1-5 years), the swelling can be very large.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Cause</strong></p><ul><li>When a mosquito bites, its secretions are injected into the skin.</li><li>The red bumps are the body's reaction to the secretions.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Mosquito Bites</strong></p><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>1. General Tips:</strong></p><ul><li>Wear long pants, a long-sleeved shirt and a hat.</li><li>Mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk. Limit your child's outdoor play during these times.</li><li>Get rid of any standing water. (Reason: It's where they lay their eggs.)</li><li>Keep mosquitoes out of your home by fixing any broken screens.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>2. DEET Products: Use on the skin.</strong></p><ul><li>DEET is a very effective bug repellent. It also repels ticks and other insects.</li><li>The AAP approves DEET use over 2 months of age. Use 30% DEET or less. Use 30% DEET if you need 6 hours of protection. Use 10% DEET if you only need protection for 2 hours. (AAP 2003).</li><li>Don't put DEET on hands if your child sucks on their thumb or fingers. (Reason: prevent swallowing DEET.)</li><li>Warn older children who apply their own DEET to use less. A total of 3 or 4 drops can protect the whole body.</li><li>Put it on exposed areas of skin. Do not use near the eyes or mouth. Do not use on skin that is covered by clothing. Don't put DEET on sunburns or rashes. Reason: DEET can be easily absorbed in these areas.</li><li>Wash it off with soap and water when your child comes indoors.</li><li>Caution: DEET can damage clothing made of man-made fibers. It can also damage plastics (such as eye glasses) and leather. DEET can be used on cotton clothing.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>3. Permethrin Products: Use on clothing.</strong></p><ul><li>Products that contain permethrin work well to repel mosquitoes. Example: Duranon.</li><li>Unlike DEET, these products are put on clothing instead of skin.</li><li>Put it on shirt cuffs, pant cuffs, shoes and hats.</li><li>Do not put permethrin on the skin. Reason: Sweat changes it so it does not work.</li></ul>\n",

No prescription is needed. Put it on 3 times a day until the itch is gone. If you don't have, use a baking soda paste until you can get some.</li><li>If neither is available, use ice in a wet washcloth for 20 minutes.</li><li>Also, you can put firm, sharp, direct, steady pressure on the bite. Do this for 10 seconds to reduce the itch. A fingernail, pen cap, or other object can be used.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Allergy Medicine for Itching:</strong><ul><li>If the bite is still itchy, try an allergy medicine by mouth. Benadryl is a good one. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Sometimes it helps, especially in allergic children.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Try Not to Scratch:</strong><ul><li>Cut the fingernails short.</li><li>Help your child not to scratch.</li><li>Reason: Prevent a skin infection at the bite site.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Antibiotic Ointment:</strong><ul><li>If the bite has a scab and looks infected, use an antibiotic ointment. An example is Polysporin. No prescription is needed. Use 3 times per day. (Note: Usually impetigo is caused by scratching bites with dirty fingers).</li><li>Cover the scab with a Band-Aid to prevent scratching and spread.</li><li>Wash the sore and use the antibiotic ointment 3 times per day. Do this until healed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Most mosquito bites itch for 3 or 4 days.</li><li>Any pinkness or redness lasts 3 or 4 days.</li><li>The swelling may last 7 days.</li><li>Bites of the upper face can cause severe swelling around the eye or ear. This does not hurt the vision and is harmless.</li><li>The swelling is often worse in the morning after lying down all night. It will improve after standing for a few hours.</li></ul></div><div><strong>West Nile Virus (WNV) - Rare:</strong><ul><li>WNV is a rare disease carried by mosquitoes. It can be spread to humans through a mosquito bite.</li><li>Only 1% of mosquitoes carry WNV.</li><li>Of people who get WNV, less than 1% get the serious kind. 80% have no symptoms. 20% get WNV fever with headache, and body aches. These symptoms last 3-6 days.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Types of Mouth Injuries</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tongue.</strong> Cuts of the <strong>tongue</strong> or inside of the cheeks are the most common mouth injury. Usually, due to accidentally biting them during eating. Bites of the tongue rarely need sutures. Even if they gape open a little, the cuts usually heal quickly. If the edges come together when the tongue is still, it needs no treatment.</li><li><strong>Upper Lip.</strong> Cuts and bruises of the <strong>upper lip</strong> are usually due to falls. The piece of tissue joining the upper lip to the gum is the frenulum. A tear of the upper frenulum is very common. It always heals without sutures. However, it will rebleed every time you pull the lip out to look at it.</li><li><strong>Lower Lip.</strong> Cuts of the <strong>lower lip</strong> are usually caused by the teeth. They occur when catching the lip between the upper and lower teeth while falling.  Most of these cuts do not connect (don't go through the lip). These do not need sutures unless the outer cut is gaping.</li><li><strong>Serious injuries</strong> are those to the tonsil, soft palate, or back of the throat. Examples of these injuries include falling with a pencil or toothbrush in the mouth.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></p><ul><li>The main symptom is pain.</li><li>Minor bleeding is also common.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention</strong></p><ul><li>Careful adult supervision of young children</li><li>Education of older children about high risk behaviors</li></ul>\n",

This tissue is called the upper labial frenulum.</li><li>The main symptom is oozing tiny amounts of blood.</li><li>This cut always heals perfectly without sutures.</li><li>For bleeding from the frenulum, use direct pressure. Press the outer lip against the teeth for 10 minutes.</li><li>Caution: Once bleeding has stopped, don't pull the lip out to look at it. Reason: The bleeding will start up again.</li><li>It's safe to look at it after 3 days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop the Bleeding - Lower Lip:</strong><ul><li>Most children who fall and bite their lower lip have 2 cuts. They have cuts to both the outside and inside of the lip.</li><li>Catching the lower lip between the upper and lower teeth causes the 2 cuts. This tends to happen in children with an overbite.</li><li>These small cuts do not connect with each other.</li><li>For bleeding from the lip, use direct pressure. Press the outer lip against the teeth for 10 minutes.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop the Bleeding -Tongue:</strong><ul><li>Bites of the tongue rarely need sutures.</li><li>Even if they gape open a little, tongue cuts usually heal quickly. If the edges come together when the tongue is still, it needs no treatment.</li><li>For tongue bleeding, try to press on the bleeding site with a sterile gauze. You can also use a piece of clean cloth. Do this for 5 minutes if it's practical.</li><li>Cuts of the tongue normally tend to ooze a little blood for several hours. This is due to the rich blood supply in the mouth.</li><li>For constant oozing of blood, can use a moistened tea bag for 10 minutes. (Reason: tannic acid released from the tea bag may stop the oozing).</li></ul></div><div><strong>Cold:</strong>  <ul><li>Put a piece of ice or popsicle on the spot that was injured.</li><li>Do this for 20 minutes.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Pain Medicine:</strong> <ul><li>To help with the pain, give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Soft Diet:</strong>  <ul><li>Try to get your child to drink adequate fluids.</li><li>Goal: Keep your child well hydrated.</li><li>Cold drinks, milk shakes, popsicles, slushes, and sherbet are good choices.</li><li>Solids. Offer a soft diet. Also avoid foods that need much chewing. Avoid citrus, salty, or spicy foods.</li><li>Rinse the wound with warm water right away after meals.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect: </strong><ul><li>Small cuts and scrapes inside the mouth heal up in 3 or 4 days.</li><li>Infections of mouth injuries are rare.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>General</strong></p><ul><li>Nose secretions are a normal part of the common cold. Most come from the sinuses. Reason: Viral sinusitis is a part of all colds.</li><li>The discharge stays clear for a few days and then becomes cloudy. Sometimes, it becomes yellow or green colored for a few days. This is still normal.</li><li>Thicker discharge is more common with sleep or low humidity. Allergy medicines also make the nose discharge thicker. Reason: All of these reduce the amount of normal nasal secretions. So, the discharge dries out.</li><li>Reality: Cough and cold medicines can't remove dried nasal discharge from the nose. Neither can antibiotics.</li><li>What to do? Nasal saline (salt water) and suction to the rescue.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Symptoms of Nasal Congestion: Is Nasal Suction Needed?</strong></p><ul><li>Nasal congestion varies in severity.</li><li>Most nasal congestion just causes a little noisy breathing. Your baby or child is not even aware of it. This kind doesn't need any treatment.</li><li>Nasal congestion needs treatment if it interferes with function.</li><li>The main example in infants is trouble during breast or bottle feeding. When the mouth is closed the baby can't breathe through the nose. Therefore, the baby has to stop feeding to breathe. This degree of blockage can be seen by putting a pacifier in the mouth.</li><li>Nasal congestion can also cause loud noisy breathing. The child is usually fussy when the breathing reaches this level. Sometimes with noisy breathing, you can't see blockage in the front of the nose. This usually means the dried mucus is farther back.</li><li>These infants need nasal saline drops or spray to loosen up the dried mucus. If you don't have, you can use bottled water or boiled tap water. Sometimes, the saline alone will cause the child to sneeze out the mucus. Other times, the saline will wash the mucus to the back of the nose. Then, it can be swallowed. Others will need nasal suction to get out the mucus.</li><li>Rule 1: Never suction without first loosening up the mucus with saline. If you don't have any, you can use a few drops of clean tap water. (If under 1 year old, use bottled water or boiled tap water.) Reason: Suction or nose blowing alone can't remove dried or sticky mucus. Use 3 drops in each nostril.</li><li>Rule 2: If the saline opens up the nose, suctioning is not needed. Goal: Avoid needless suctioning.</li><li>Another option: Use a warm shower to loosen mucus.</li><li>For young children, can also use a wet cotton swab to remove sticky mucus.</li><li>Caution: Never use the suction bulb to put the saline in the nose. Reason: Suction bulbs are usually dirty with germs.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Nasal Suction - How to Do It If Your Child Needs It</strong>:<ul><li>Nasal suction must be done gently.</li><li>Put in a few drops of saline.</li><li>Compress the suction bulb.</li><li>Then put the tip inside the nasal opening, but not very far.</li><li>Create a seal by pressing the outer nose against the tip.</li><li>Then release the bulb so it will pull in secretions.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Prevention of Side Effects</strong>:<ul><li>Putting the bulb in too far will cause trauma to the nose lining. It will hurt and can cause swelling.</li><li>Sometimes, it causes bleeding. A nosebleed after nasal suction means it was done too forceful.</li><li>Suction gently and try to limit to 4 or less times per day. Suctioning too often can cause increased swelling and congestion.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Best Suction Device</strong>:<ul><li>Buy a suction bulb with a blunt tip. Buy one that completely covers the nasal opening.</li><li>Better yet, buy a NoseFrida or Baby Comfy Nose. They are special nasal aspirators that makes a seal without entering the nose. They are 10 times more powerful than a suction bulb. They cost around $15, but reviews suggest it's worth it.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Older Children and Blowing the Nose:</strong><ul><li>Older children can blow their nose once they are 3 - 4 years old. Then, they no longer need nasal suction.</li><li>But, in winters with low humidity and forced heat, they still need nasal saline. This will loosen up mucus before blowing. Otherwise, the mucus often holds tight.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Nasal Flushes and Teens:</strong><ul><li>This is when saline is squirted in one nostril and comes out the other.</li><li>Most kids hate nasal flushes, so they are not advised until the teen years.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Breast Questions: Swollen Breasts</strong><ul><li>Swollen breasts are present during the first week of life in many babies. Breasts can be swollen in both girl and boy babies. The nipple area is always firm.</li><li><strong>Cause.</strong> The passage of the mother's estrogen across the placenta.</li><li><strong>Newborn Milk.</strong> Sometimes, the nipples leak a few drops of milkish discharge. This is normal and can last a few weeks.</li><li><strong>Normal Course.</strong> Swollen breasts often last for 2 to 4 weeks. In breastfed babies, some breast swelling can persist for 6 months.</li><li><strong>Caution:</strong> NEVER squeeze or massage the breast or nipple. (Reason: Can cause a serious infection.)</li><li><strong>Call your doctor</strong> <strong>if</strong>: Swollen breast develops any redness, streaking, or tenderness.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ear and Nose Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Ear Folded Over.</strong> The ears of newborns are commonly soft and floppy. Sometimes one of the edges is folded over. The cartilage will slowly harden over the first few weeks. This will cause the outer ear to assume a normal shape.</li><li><strong>Flattened Nose.</strong> The nose can become misshapen during the birth process. It may be flattened or pushed to one side. It will look normal by 1 week of age.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Eye Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Bleeding in Eye.</strong> A flame-shaped red streak on the white of the eye is common. It's harmless and due to a birth canal injury. The blood will go away in 2 to 3 weeks.</li><li><strong>Swollen Eyelids.</strong> The eyes may be puffy due to pressure on the face during delivery. They may be puffy and reddened if silver nitrate eyedrops were used at birth. This irritation should clear in 3 days.</li><li><strong>Tear Duct, Blocked.</strong> A constantly watery eye may be a sign of a blocked tear duct. A channel normally carries tears from the eye to the nose. A blocked tear duct means this channel is blocked. Ask your doctor about this during office hours. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Genital Questions (Female):</strong><ul><li><strong>Vaginal Tags.</strong> The hymen can be swollen due to maternal estrogen. It can have smooth ½ inch projections of pink tissue. These normal vaginal (hymenal) tags occur in 10 percent of newborn girls. They slowly shrink over 2 to 4 weeks.</li><li><strong>Vaginal Discharge.</strong> As the maternal estrogen declines in your baby's blood, a vaginal discharge may occur. This discharge is usually clear or white. Sometimes, the discharge will become pink or blood-tinged (false menstruation). This normal discharge should not last more than 3 or 4 days. Discharge from the vagina can occur between 3 and 10 days of life.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Genital Questions (Male):</strong><ul><li><strong>Swollen Scrotum (Hydrocele).</strong> The newborn scrotum can be filled with clear fluid. This fluid is squeezed into the scrotum during the birth process. It slowly goes away over 6 to 12 months.</li><li><strong>No Testicle (Undescended).</strong> The testicle is not in the scrotum in about 4% of full-term newborns. Many of these testicles gradually descend into the normal position during the following months. By 1 year of age, less than 1% of all testicles are undescended. These need to be brought down surgically.</li><li><strong>Tight Foreskin.</strong> Most babies that aren't circumcised have a tight foreskin. Because of this, you can't see the head of the penis. This is normal in infants. The foreskin should not be pulled back.</li><li><strong>Circumcision.</strong> A circumcision is the removal of most of the male foreskin. For questions about circumcisions, ask your doctor.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Hair Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Scalp Hair.</strong> Most hair at birth is dark-colored. This hair is temporary and begins to shed by 1 month of age. Some babies lose it slowly while the permanent hair is coming in. Others lose it quickly and become bald for a short time. The permanent hair will begin to appear by 6 months. It may be an entirely different color from the newborn hair.</li><li><strong>Body Hair (Lanugo).</strong> Lanugo is the fine, downy hair that is sometimes on the back and shoulders. It is more common in premature infants. It is rubbed off with normal friction by 2 to 4 weeks of age.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Head</strong> <strong>Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Caput</strong> is a swelling on top of the head or throughout the scalp. It is due to fluid squeezed into the scalp during the birth process. Caput is present at birth and clears in a few days. It's normal, harmless and painless.</li><li><strong>Cephalohematoma</strong> is a collection of blood on the outer surface of the skull. It is due to friction between the skull and the pelvis during birth. The lump is usually confined to one side of the head. It does not cross the midline. It first appears on the second day of life. It may increase in size for up to 5 days. It doesn't go away completely until 2 or 3 months of age. <strong>Call your doctor if</strong>: The swelling becomes large.</li><li><strong>Molding.</strong> Molding refers to the long, narrow, cone-shaped head. This is from passage through a tight birth canal. This compression of the head can temporarily hide the fontanel (soft spot). The head returns to a normal shape in a few days.</li><li><strong>Soft Spot (Anterior Fontanel).</strong> The front &quot;soft spot&quot; is diamond-shaped. It is covered by a thick fibrous layer. Touching this area is quite safe. The purpose of the soft spot is to allow rapid growth of the brain. The soft spot will normally pulsate with each beat of the heart. It closes over with bone between 12 and 18 months of age. (Normal range is 5 to 24 months of age.) The back &quot;soft spot&quot; is smaller and triangular-shaped. It closes between 2 and 3 months.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Leg and Feet Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Bowed Legs.</strong> The lower legs (tibia) normally curve in. This is because of the cross-legged posture while in the womb. If you stand your baby up, the upper legs will be bowed. Both of these curves are normal. These curves will straighten out after the child has been walking for 6 to 12 months.</li><li><strong>Feet Turned In, Out or Up.</strong> Feet can turn any which way. This is due to the cramped quarters inside the womb. This is normal if the feet can be easily moved to a normal position. The feet should be flexible. The direction of the feet will become more normal between 6 and 12 months of age.</li><li><strong>&quot;Ingrown&quot; Toenails.</strong> Many newborns have soft nails that easily bend and curve. However, they are not truly ingrown because they don't cut into the flesh.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Mouth Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Tongue-Tie.</strong> A short, tight band that connects the tongue to the mouth in newborns. This band normally stretches with time, movement, and growth. Tongue-tie rarely causes any symptoms.</li><li><strong>Epithelial Pearls.</strong> Little white-colored cysts can occur in the mouth. Look along the gumline or on the hard palate. These are due to blockage of normal mucous glands from friction with sucking. They go away by 1 to 2 months of age.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Teeth Questions:</strong><ul><li>The presence of a tooth at birth is a rare event.</li><li>About 10 percent of them are extra teeth without a root structure.</li><li>The other 90 percent are prematurely erupted normal teeth. The distinction can be made with an X-ray.</li><li>The extra teeth should be removed, usually by a dentist.</li><li>The normal teeth need to be removed only if they become loose. Reason: Risk of choking. They should also be removed if they cause sores on the tongue.  </li></ul></div>\n",

Acne consists of small red bumps.</li><li>This baby acne begins at 3 or 4 weeks of age. It lasts until 4 to 6 months of age.</li><li>The cause appears to be the transfer of maternal hormones just prior to birth.</li><li>Since it goes away on its own, no treatment is needed. Baby oil or ointments make it worse.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Drooling or Spit-up Rash:</strong><ul><li>Many babies have a rash on the chin or cheeks that comes and goes. This is often due to contact with food. It can also be from acid that has been spit up from the stomach. Prolonged contact with spitup during sleep can cause the rash to get worse.</li><li>Other temporary rashes on the face are heat rashes. These can occur in areas held against the mother's skin during nursing. Heat rashes are more common in the summertime.</li><li>Rinse the face with water after all feedings or spitting up. Do not use soap on the rash. Reason: Soaps can slow healing.</li><li>Heat rash also can cause a rash on the face. During hot weather, change the baby's position more often. Also, put a cool washcloth on the rash.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Erythema Toxicum:</strong><ul><li>More than 50 percent of babies get a rash called erythema toxicum. It starts on the second or third day of life.</li><li>It's a harmless baby rash that doesn't need to be seen.</li><li>The rash is made up red blotches. They are ½ inch to 1 inch (1 to 2.5 cm). The blotches have a small white or yellow &quot;pimple&quot; in the center.</li><li>They look like insect bites, but are not. Red blotches are the main feature.</li><li>They can be numerous, keep occurring, and look terrible. They can occur anywhere on the body surface, except the palms and soles.</li><li>Their cause is unknown, but they are not an infection.</li><li>They go away by 2 weeks of age.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Forceps or Birth Canal Injury:</strong><ul><li>The pressure of a forceps on the skin can leave marks. You may see bruises or scrapes anywhere on the head or face.</li><li>During birth, skin overlying bony prominences can become damaged. You might see this on the sides of the skull bone. This is from pressure from the birth canal. Even without a forceps delivery, you may see bruises or scrapes.</li><li>Fetal monitors can also cause scrapes and scabs on the scalp.</li><li>The bruises and scrapes will be noted on day 1 or day 2. They go away by 1 to 2 weeks.</li><li>A fat tissue injury won't appear until day 5 to 10. Look for a firm coin-shaped lump. It will be under the skin and sometimes with a scab. This lump may take 3 or 4 weeks to go away.</li><li>For any breaks in the skin, apply an antibiotic ointment. An example is Polysporin. No prescription is needed. Use 3 times per day until healed.</li><li><strong>Call Your Doctor If:</strong></li><li>It becomes tender to the touch</li><li>Becomes soft in the center</li><li>Starts to looks infected</li></ul></div><div><strong>Milia:</strong><ul><li>Milia are tiny white bumps that occur on the face. Milia occur in 40 percent of newborn babies.</li><li>The nose and cheeks are most often involved. Milia can also be seen on the forehead and chin.</li><li>Milia are many in number. They occur equally on both sides of the face.</li><li>Although they look like pimples, they are much smaller (pinhead size). They are not infected.</li><li>They do not look like water blisters.</li><li>They are blocked-off skin pores. They will open up.</li><li>Milia will go away by 1 to 2 months of age.</li><li>No treatment is needed. Ointments or creams can make them worse.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Normal Primitive Reflexes From Immature Nervous System:</strong><ul><li><strong>Startle Reflex</strong> (Moro or embrace reflex). Brief stiffening of the body, straightening of arms and opening of hands. Follows noise or abrupt movements. Frequent at birth. Slowly resolves by 4 months of age.</li><li><strong>Tonic-Neck Reflex</strong> (Fencer's Reflex). When head is turned to 1 side, the arm and leg on that side straightens. The opposite arm and leg flexes. Goes away by 4 months of age.</li><li><strong>Chin Trembling</strong></li><li><strong>Lower Lip Quivering</strong></li><li><strong>Jitters or Trembling</strong> (see Topic 2)</li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal Jitters or Trembling when Crying:</strong><ul><li>Jitters or trembling of the arms and legs during crying is normal in newborns. It should stop by 1 to 2 months of age.</li><li>If your baby is jittery when not crying, it could be abnormal. Give her something to suck on. (Reason: Normal trembling should stop with sucking.)</li><li>Seizures are rare. During seizures, newborns are more than jittery. They have muscle jerking and blinking of the eyes. Babies can also make sucking movements of the mouth. They don't cry during seizures.</li><li><strong>Call Your Doctor If:</strong></li><li>The jitters get worse</li><li>The jitters occur when your baby is calm</li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal Sleep Movements:</strong><ul><li>Sleep is not quiet. Expect some of the following:</li><li>Sudden jerks or twitches of the arms, hands or legs. If they only occur during sleep, they are most likely normal.</li><li>How Long: last a few seconds, but can recur</li><li>Timing: soon after falling asleep</li><li>Normal at all ages, not just in newborns</li><li>Suspect a seizure if: jerking occurs when awake or lasts more than 10 seconds</li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal Breathing Sounds and Noises:</strong><ul><li><strong>Throat Noises.</strong> Caused by air passing through normal saliva or refluxed milk. These gurgling noises are likely to build up during sleep. Slowly, the newborn learns to swallow more often.</li><li><strong>Nasal Noises</strong> are usually caused by dried mucus in the nose. Your baby most likely doesn't have a cold. A blocked or stuffy nose can interfere with feeding. This is because your baby can't breathe when the mouth is closed with feeding. Therefore, babies need help opening the nasal passages. Clean out a blocked nose with normal saline. (See Advice #5)</li><li><strong>Tobacco Smoke</strong><em>.</em> Avoid tobacco smoke which can cause nasal congestion or sneezing. Avoid dust or any strong odors for the same reason.</li><li><strong>Call Your Doctor If:</strong></li><li>Nasal washes don't work</li><li>Breathing becomes hard</li></ul></div><div><strong>Nasal Saline to Open a Blocked Nose in a Newborn: </strong><ul><li>Use saline (salt water) nose drops or spray. If not available, can use bottled water.</li><li>Use 1 drop and do one side at a time. Repeat this several times.</li><li>This will loosen up the dried mucus. Then it can be sneezed out or swallowed.</li><li>If needed, use a suction bulb. Avoid Q-tips which can injure the lining of the nose.</li><li>Reason for saline nose drops: Suction alone can't remove dried or sticky mucus.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal Irregular Breathing Patterns:</strong><ul><li><strong>Transient Breathing Pauses of Less Than 10 Seconds. Also Called Periodic Breathing.</strong> These breathing pauses are normal if the baby is comfortable during them. A normal rate should be less than 60 breaths per minute. Usually resolves by 1 month of age. <strong>Call your doctor if</strong>: Your baby is breathing fast or turned blue.</li><li><strong>Transient Rapid Breathing.</strong> Sometimes, newborns take rapid, progressively deeper breaths. This is so they can expand their lungs all the way. This is normal if the breathing slows to normal within a minute or so.</li><li><strong>Seesaw Breathing.</strong> With breathing, the chest seems to contract when the stomach expands. The cause is the soft rib cage of some newborns. It tends to pull in during normal downward movement of the diaphragm.</li><li><strong>Yawning or Sighing</strong> (off and on) to open up the lungs</li><li><strong>Call Your Doctor If:</strong></li><li>Breathing becomes hard</li><li>Breathing pauses last more than 10 seconds</li><li>You have other questions or concerns</li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal GI Sounds And Noises:</strong><ul><li>Belching air from stomach</li><li>Passing gas per rectum</li><li>NOTE: Both of these are releasing swallowed air. They are normal, harmless and lifelong. They do not cause pain or crying.</li><li>Gurgling or growling noises from the movement of food through the intestines</li><li>Normal grunting with pushing out stools</li><li>Hiccups. Hiccups are often caused by overeating. They can also be from a little acid irritating the lower esophagus. Give your baby a few swallows of water to rinse off the lower esophagus.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal Sleep Sounds And Noises:</strong> Normal sleep is not motionless or quiet. Expect some of the following:<ul><li>Moving during sleep transitions</li><li>Occasional startle reflex or jerks</li><li>Breathing noises - especially gurgling from secretions that sit in the throat.</li><li>During light sleep, babies can normally whimper, cry, groan or make other strange noises.</li><li>Parents who use a nursery monitor often become concerned about these normal sleep sounds.</li><li>GI tract noises from normal movement of digested food</li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal Feeding Reflexes:</strong><ul><li><strong>Rooting Reflex</strong><em>.</em> When the side of the mouth or cheek is touched, your baby turns to that side. He will open his mouth in preparation for nursing. Present until 6 months of age.</li><li><strong>Sucking Reflex</strong><em>.</em> Will suck on anything placed in the mouth. This survival reflex does not imply hunger. It is even present right after a feeding. This reflex fades between 6 and 12 months of age.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Normal Protective Reflexes:</strong><ul><li><strong>Sneezing To Clear Nose of Any Irritant</strong><em>.</em> Sneezing helps to open the nose. It's usually caused by dust, fuzz, tobacco smoke or other strong odors. If sneezing becomes frequent, use nasal washes. This is not caused by an allergy.</li><li><strong>Coughing </strong>to clear lower airway</li><li><strong>Blinking</strong>. After spending 9 months in darkness, newborns have light-sensitive eyes. At first, they prefer to keep their eyes closed. They blink often with light exposure.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Overview:</strong><ul><li>Hay fever is very common. It happens in about 15% of children.</li><li>Nose and eye symptoms can be controlled by giving allergy medicines. Use either a short-acting (Benadryl) or long-acting (Zyrtec).</li><li>Pollens are in the air every day during pollen season. So, allergy meds must be given daily.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Allergy Medicines Short-Acting:</strong><ul><li>Allergy medicines are called antihistamines. They are the drug of choice for nasal allergies.</li><li>They will help control the symptoms. These include a runny nose, nasal itching and sneezing.</li><li>Benadryl is helpful. No prescription is needed. It needs to be given every 6 to 8 hours.</li><li>The bedtime dosage is especially important for healing the lining of the nose.</li><li>The key to control is to give allergy meds every day during pollen season.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Allergy Medicines Long-Acting:</strong><ul><li>Cetirizine (Zyrtec) is a long-acting (LA) allergy medicine. Other LA products are Loratadine (Claritin) and Fexofenadine (Allegra). No prescription is needed. </li><li>Advantage: Causes less sedation than older allergy meds such as Benadryl. They are long-acting and last up to 24 hours.</li><li>AGE limit: all 3 products are approved for age 2 years and older.</li><li>Dosage: see package label.</li><li>Downside: Doesn't control hay fever symptoms as well as older allergy medicines. Also, sometimes will have breakthrough symptoms before 24 hours. If that happens, you can give a single dose of Benadryl.</li><li>Cost: Ask the pharmacist for a store brand. Reason: Costs less than Claritin or Zyrtec brand.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Nasal Saline to Wash Out Pollen:</strong><ul><li>Use saline (salt water) nose drops or spray. This helps to wash out pollen or to loosen up dried mucus. If you don't have saline, you can use bottled water or a few drops of clean tap water.</li><li>STEP 1: Put 3 drops in each nostril.</li><li>STEP 2: Blow each nostril out while closing off the other nostril.</li><li>STEP 3: Repeat nose drops and blowing until the discharge is clear.</li><li>How often: Do nasal saline rinses when the nose is very itchy or blocked.</li><li>Saline nose drops or spray can be bought in any drugstore. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Saline nose drops can also be made at home. Use 1/2 teaspoon (2 ml) of table salt. Stir the salt into 1 cup (8 ounces or 240 ml) of clean water. You must use bottled or boiled water for this purpose.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Eye Allergies:</strong><ul><li>For eye symptoms, wash off the face and eyelids. This will remove pollen.</li><li>Most often, an allergy medicine given by mouth will help the eye symptoms. Sometimes, eye drops are also needed.</li><li><strong>Antihistamine Eye Drops - Ketotifen (1st Choice)</strong>.  Dose: 1 drop every 12 hours.</li><li>Examples are Zaditor or Alaway. No prescription is needed.</li><li>For best control, use ketotifen eyedrops every day during pollen season. </li><li><strong>Antihistamine/Vasoconstrictive Eyedrops (2nd Choice).</strong> Dose: 1 drop every 8 hours</li><li>Ask your pharmacist to suggest a brand. Some are Naphcon A, Opcon A, or Visine A.</li><li>Do not use this type for over 5 days. (Reason: Will cause red eyes from rebound effect).</li></ul></div><div><strong>Wash Pollen Off Body:</strong><ul><li>Remove pollen from the hair and skin with shampoo and a shower. </li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Antihistamines should bring your allergy symptoms under control quickly.</li><li>Since pollen allergies recur each year, learn to control the symptoms.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Prevention - How to Reduce the Pollen Your Child Breathes:</strong><ul><li>Pollen is carried in the air.</li><li>Keep windows closed in the home, at least in your child's bedroom.</li><li>Keep windows closed in car. Turn the air conditioner on recirculate.</li><li>Avoid window fans or attic fans. They pull in pollen.</li><li>Try to stay indoors on windy days. Reason: The pollen count is much higher.</li><li>Avoid playing with the outdoor dog. Reason: Pollen collects in the fur.</li><li>Pollen Count: Get your daily pollen count from www.pollen.com.

Injuries to the cartilage do not show up on X-ray.</li><li>Looking at the nose after the swelling is gone is preferred. You can usually do this by day 4 or 5. This is the best way to tell if it is fractured. It will look different than it used to. Delayed correction also helps the surgeon better see what needs to be corrected.</li><li>Caution: If the nose is broken, a surgeon must re-set it. This should be done BEFORE the 10th day.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Nose pain and swelling usually peak on day 2.</li><li>They go away over 3 or 4 days.</li></ul></div>\n",

Reason it works: The gauze puts more pressure on the bleeding spot. </li><li>Special nose drops: If your child has lots of nosebleeds, buy some decongestant nose drops. An example is Afrin. No prescription is needed. Put 3 drops on the gauze, insert and press. These nose drops also shrink the blood vessels in the nose.</li><li>Caution: don't use decongestant nose drops if your child is younger than 1 year.</li><li>If you don't have gauze, use a piece of paper towel. </li><li>Repeat the process of gently squeezing the lower soft parts of the nose.  Do this for 10 minutes. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Prevention of Recurrent Nosebleeds:</strong><ul><li>If the air in your home is dry, use a humidifier. This will keep the nose from drying out.</li><li>For nose blowing, blow gently.</li><li>For nose suctioning, don't put the suction tip very far inside. Also, move it gently.</li><li>Do not use aspirin and ibuprofen. Reason: Increases bleeding tendency.</li><li>Bleeding areas in the front of the nose sometimes develop a scab. The scab may heal slowly and re-bleed. If that happens to your child, try this: Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to the spot. Repeat twice daily for a few days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Over 99% of nosebleeds will stop if you press on the right spot.</li><li>It may take 10 minutes of direct pressure.</li><li>After swallowing blood from a nosebleed, your child may vomit a little blood.</li><li>Your child may also pass a dark stool tomorrow from swallowed blood.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Main Benefit: Prevent Thumb Sucking</strong></p><ul><li>The amount of extra sucking babies need when they are not hungry varies. This extra sucking seems to be for self-soothing and self-comforting.</li><li>Some babies suck on their thumb or fingers almost constantly. If you have a baby like this, try to interest him in a pacifier. To be accepted as a substitute for the thumb, introduce it before 2 months.</li><li>Pacifier sucking is harmless compared to thumb sucking. Thumb sucking can cause a severe overbite if continued after permanent teeth come in. A pacifier exerts less pressure on the teeth and causes a minor overbite. However, dentists do recommend stopping a pacifier by age 2.</li><li>The main benefit is you can control your child's use of a pacifier. You can decide when to stop it. If over 12 months old, he will rarely start late thumb sucking if you take it away.</li><li>In contrast, it is much more difficult to stop your child from sucking his thumb. This is because his thumb belongs to him.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Main Risk: Pacifier Dependency</strong></p><ul><li>Pacifier dependency is when a child always wants the pacifier with him.</li><li>It's his constant companion. He feels like the pacifier belongs to him. He walks around with it in his mouth.</li><li>He can't fall asleep without it in his mouth. Following normal awakenings at night, he can't fall back to sleep without the pacifier. If he can't find it, he cries for his parent to help him. Normal infants can't find, pickup and re-insert a pacifier until 10 to 12 months old.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Reasons to Phase Out the Pacifier By 12 Months of Life</strong></p><ul><li>A pacifier can interfere with normal babbling and speech development. It's hard for a child to talk with a pacifier in his mouth.</li><li>A pacifier in the mouth can also interfere with learning normal facial expressions.</li><li>A pacifier also encourages a child to continue exploring the world with his mouth. He should be doing it with his hands.</li><li>Older children will strongly resist pacifier weaning. Bad habits become harder to break with each passing month. After age 2, taking away the pacifier may cause a battle.</li><li>He probably won't agree to give it up on his own until 4 years.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Pacifier Dependency: Prevention</strong></p><p class=\"rteBlock\">If you allow your child to use a pacifier all the time, his interest in it will increase. To ensure your child doesn't become overly attached to a pacifier, consider the tips below:</p><ul><li>During your child's first 6 months, use the pacifier only when he wants to suck but isn't hungry.</li><li>The only exception is during the first month of life and you are breastfeeding. This is when breastmilk is coming in and milk supply is being established. Sucking and feeding from the breast are what make moms produce milk. So, we want all that sucking energy to go towards making more milk. If it's been more than 90 minutes since the last nursing, your newborn is hungry. For formula fed babies, the pacifier is fine unless your baby is hungry.</li><li>Be careful not to offer a pacifier every time he cries. Crying has a number of causes besides hunger and a need to suck. Try swaddling or rocking. (see Crying handout).</li><li>When your baby seems unhappy, first use cuddling. This provides comfort instead of offering the pacifier. Try not to overuse the pacifier while you are comforting your baby.</li><li>If your baby uses a pacifier, don't forget to take it with you for air travel. Sucking a pacifier or swallowing fluids during descent can prevent ear pain.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Prevent Thumb Sucking with a Pacifier:</strong> <ul><li>The peak age for thumbsucking or using a pacifier is 2 to 4 months.</li><li>In the following months, the urge to suck normally decreases.</li><li>Babies find other ways to soothe themselves.</li><li>Here are some tips for normal pacifier use in young babies. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Pick a Date to Give Up the Pacifier:</strong> <ul><li>Help your child pick a date to give up the pacifier.</li><li>Sometimes giving it up on a birthday or holiday is easier for your child.</li><li>Ensure your child is not coping with other changes or fears at that time.</li><li>Then &quot;do it&quot;. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Limit Pacifier Times to When Awake and Holding Your Baby:</strong><ul><li>Limit pacifier use to times you are holding your baby.</li><li>If you do so, he will usually lose interest in it by 6 to 9 months.</li><li>If your child seems to want a security object while he is awake, don't give him a pacifier. Use a stuffed animal.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Make the Transition as Pleasant as Possible: </strong><ul><li>Tell him the dentist or doctor said it was time to stop. </li><li>Say &quot;it will make your teeth happy&quot;. </li><li>Never use punishment to force your child to give up the pacifier.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Use a Pacifier For Sleep:</strong><ul><li>Do not use a pacifier to help your baby fall asleep.</li><li>Keep the pacifier out of the crib.</li><li>Reason: It will become a bad habit. Your baby won't be able to fall asleep without it in his mouth. Then after normal awakenings at night, he can't fall back to sleep without the pacifier. Babies can't find their pacifier and put it back in their mouth until about 10 months old. So they will cry for you to come and find and re-insert it for them. That's how a pacifier turns into a sleep problem.</li><li>Use a pacifier to help calm your baby if they are crying. Use only if you are also holding them and before you put them in the crib.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Giving up the Pacifier - Use Incentives:</strong><ul><li>If your child is strongly attached to a pacifier, you may need to offer incentives. Night time pacifiers are hardest to give up. </li><li>Encourage him to trade the pacifier for something he really wants. Perhaps a stuffed animal, book, video or special toy. Have him give the pacifier to the clerk at the toy store.</li><li>Some children will agree to just throw it out. </li><li>Others may want to leave it out for Santa Claus or the &quot;pacifier fairy&quot;. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Control When You Offer Your Baby a Pacifier:</strong><ul><li>Don't allow a pacifier during car or stroller rides.</li><li>Do not allow your child to carry around a pacifier.</li><li>Don't use a pacifier for teething. Do use a teether for sore gums. It teaches a chewing motion rather than sucking.</li><li>Do not let him think that the pacifier belongs to him.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Comfort and Praise Your Child:</strong><ul><li>At times of missing the pacifier, comfort your child with cuddling. </li><li>Help your child talk about missing the pacifier. </li><li>But once it's gone, never bring it back.</li><li>Praise your child for this sign of growing up.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Start Phasing Pacifier Out at 6 Months of Age:</strong><ul><li>After 6 months when your baby starts to crawl, use the pacifier less often. </li><li>Keep it out of sight when not in use.</li></ul></div>\n",

It can thin the secretions and loosen the cough. If you don't have any honey, you can use corn syrup.</li><li>AGE 6 years and older: Use COUGH DROPS to decrease the tickle in the throat. If you don't have any, you can use hard candy.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Non-Prescription Cough Medicine (DM):</strong><ul><li>Don't give cough suppressant medicines (such as those with dextromethorphan) to children with pneumonia.</li><li>Reason: We want children to cough up secretions. Coughing helps protect the lungs by clearing out germs.</li><li>Also, OTC cough medicines aren't approved by the FDA for children under 4 years old.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Coughing Fits or Spells:</strong><ul><li>Breathe warm mist (such as with shower running in a closed bathroom).</li><li>Give warm clear fluids to drink. Examples are apple juice and lemonade. </li><li>Reason: Both relax the airway and loosen up any phlegm.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Fluids:</strong><ul><li>Try to get your child to drink lots of fluids.</li><li>Goal: Keep your child well hydrated.</li><li>It loosens up any phlegm in the lungs. Then it's easier to cough up.</li><li>It also will thin out the mucus discharge from the nose.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Humidifier:</strong> <ul><li>If the air in your home is dry, use a humidifier. Reason: Dry air makes coughs worse.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Fever:</strong><ul><li>For fevers above 102° F (39° C), give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. See Dose Table. Note: Lower fevers are important for fighting infections.</li><li>For ALL fevers: Keep your child well hydrated. Give lots of cold fluids.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Avoid Tobacco Smoke:</strong> <ul><li>Tobacco smoke makes coughs much worse.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Fever usually goes away in 3 days.</li><li>Recovery is gradual and may take 2 to 4 weeks.</li><li>Recovery will be complete.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return to School:</strong><ul><li>Your child can go back to school after the fever is gone.</li><li>Your child should also feel well enough to join in normal activities.</li><li>Most children who are exposed to viral pneumonia just get cold symptoms. A few may get pneumonia.</li></ul></div>\n",

A common one is the Coxsackie virus.</li><li>Viral rashes are more common with summer viruses.</li><li>Some viruses can be diagnosed by the pattern of the rash. A good example is Hand-Foot-and-Mouth disease. It starts with red spots and tiny blisters on the palms and soles. </li><li>Some viruses can be diagnosed by the pattern of the fever (Roseola). The rash starts 12 to 24 hours after the fever goes away. Most children get Roseola between 6 months and 3 years of age.</li><li>Hives is likely if the rash is bumpy and itchy. Most cases of hives are also caused by a virus. Hives can also be an allergic reaction.</li><li>Heat rash</li><li>Insect bites</li><li>Sunburn</li><li>Widespread rashes with fever need to be seen, if they have not been diagnosed. Reason: There are some serious infections that can cause these rashes.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Viral Rashes and Drug Rashes</strong></p><ul><li>Prescription medicines sometimes cause widespread rashes. Some are allergic, but most are not.</li><li>Non-prescription (OTC) medicines rarely cause any rashes.</li><li>Most rashes that occur while taking an OTC medicine are viral rashes.</li><li>Fever medicines (acetaminophen and ibuprofen) cause the most needless worry. Reason: Most viral rashes start with a fever. Hence, the child is taking a fever medicine when the rash starts. But the fever medicine had nothing to do with the rash.</li><li>Drug rashes can't be diagnosed over the phone.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Spread to Others</strong></p><ul><li>Good hand washing can prevent spread of infection.</li></ul>\n",

If your child's rash is itchy, here are some tips.</li><li><strong>Cool Bath.</strong> For flare-ups of itching, give your child a cool bath. Do this for 10 minutes. Avoid all soaps. Reason: Soaps, especially bubble bath, make the skin dry and itchy. Option: Can add 2 ounces (60 ml) of baking soda per tub.</li><li><strong>Moisturizing Cream.</strong> Use a moisturizing cream once or twice daily. Examples are Eucerin or Cetaphil creams. Apply the cream after the bath. Reason: Water-soaked skin feels less itchy.</li><li><strong>Steroid Cream.</strong> For relief of severe itching, use 1% hydrocortisone cream on the most itchy areas. No prescription is needed. Do this 3 times per day.</li><li><strong>Scratching.</strong> Encourage your child not to scratch. Cut the fingernails short. Reason: Prevent a skin infection from bacteria.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Other Symptoms:</strong><ul><li>Treat any other viral symptoms (such as diarrhea) in the usual way.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Fever:</strong><ul><li>For fevers above 102° F (39° C), give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Note: Lower fevers are important for fighting infections.</li><li>For ALL fevers: Keep your child well hydrated. Give lots of cold fluids.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>Most viral rashes go away in 2-3 days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return to School:</strong><ul><li>If your child has a fever, avoid contact with other children. Also try to avoid contact with pregnant women.</li><li>Most viral rashes cannot be spread to others once the fever is gone.</li><li>For minor rashes, your child can return after the FEVER is gone.</li><li>For major rashes, your child can return after the RASH is gone. If your doctor has given medical clearance to return, can go back sooner.</li></ul></div>\n",

Going to school must be a strict rule.</li></ul></div><div><strong>See the Doctor When Staying Home:</strong> <ul><li>If your child has a new symptom or seems quite sick, keep her home.</li><li>Call your doctor's office as soon as it opens. Try to have her seen that morning.</li><li>If the symptom is caused by a disease, correct treatment can be started.</li><li>If the symptom is from school phobia, she can go along to school. Ideally, this is the same day and before noon.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ask the School For Help:</strong><ul><li>Schools are usually very understanding about school phobia because it is a common problem.</li><li>If your child has special fears, the teacher will usually make special allowances. An example of this fear is talking in front of the class. </li><li>If the symptoms act up, ask the school to allow your child to lie down. Laying down for 10 minutes will help her regroup. This can be an option rather than sending her home.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Talk With Your Child About School Fears: </strong><ul><li>At a time other than school mornings, talk with your child about her problems. </li><li>Help her to tell you exactly what upsets her. </li><li>If there's a situation you can change, tell her you will work on it. While you address the problem, she must still go to school.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>If daily school attendance is enforced, symptoms in most children will go away. They will be much improved in 1 or 2 weeks.</li><li>Symptoms may recur after summer or other vacations. This requires the parents to put the tough love treatment plan back in effect.</li></ul></div>\n",

It follows the path of a nerve</li><li>Occurs on only one side of the body</li><li>Starts with clusters of red bumps and changes to water blisters. It finally becomes dry crusts. It looks like small groups of chickenpox sores.</li><li>Is most commonly found on the back, chest, or abdomen</li><li>Usually doesn't burn or itch in children (as it does for adults)</li><li>Your child will not have a fever or feel sick.</li><li>Shingles rarely occurs before 3 years old</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Cause</strong></p><ul><li>Shingles (zoster) is caused by the chickenpox virus (varicella virus).</li><li>In some people the chickenpox virus stays inactive (dormant) in their bodies. For unknown reasons, the virus can re-appear as shingles, not as chickenpox.</li><li>Your child can only get shingles if he or she has already had chickenpox. </li><li>Shingles can also happen in children who had the chickenpox vaccine. These cases of shingles are mild compared to regular shingles.</li><li>The disease is NOT caught from other people who have shingles or chickenpox.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention</strong></p><ul><li>The chickenpox vaccine decreases the shingles rate by 40%.</li></ul>\n",

Put it on the spots that itch the most. Do this 3 times per day, as needed. </li><li>You can also rub an ice cube on the itchy spots for 10 minutes.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Benadryl Medicine for Itching:</strong><ul><li>If itching becomes severe or interferes with sleep, give Benadryl by mouth.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Try Not to Scratch:</strong><ul><li>Try not to let your child pick and scratch at the sores. This can lead to infected sores.</li><li>Trim fingernails.</li><li>Wash hands often with soap.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Pain Medicine:</strong><ul><li>To help with any pain, give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed.</li><li>Never give aspirin to children. Reason: possible link of aspirin with Reye's syndrome.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>The red bumps and blisters in the stripe get worse for several days.</li><li>The rash dries up by 7 to 10 days.</li><li>About 20% of adults with shingles have chronic nerve pain after the rash is gone. The pain can last for 6 months or longer. Children do not get this complication.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return to School:</strong><ul><li>The shingles sores contain the chickenpox virus. So children with shingles can transmit chickenpox (but not shingles) to others. Spread occurs by touching the rash.</li><li>Prevention of spread: Cover the shingles rash.</li><li>Children can go to school if the rash can be kept covered by clothing.</li><li>If it can't be covered (such as on the face), children need to stay home until it crusts over. That takes 7 days on average.</li><li>Avoid contact with anyone who has never had the chickenpox disease or vaccine. Also avoid contact with anyone who has a weak immune system.</li></ul></div>\n",

Tell him, &quot;We never hurt babies.&quot; </li><li>Send your child to &quot;time-out&quot; for a few minutes. </li><li>Don't spank your child or slap his hand at these times.

Since it's their problem, let them find their own solution whenever possible.</li></ul></div><div><strong>If an Argument Becomes Too Loud, Do Something About It: </strong><ul><li>If the arguing becomes annoying or interferes with your ability to think, go to your children and tell them, &quot;I do not want to hear your arguing. Please settle your differences quietly or find another place to argue&quot;. </li><li>If they continue arguing loudly, send them to the basement, outdoors, or to time-out in separate rooms. </li><li>If arguing over a toy, make it &quot;your toy&quot; for the rest of the day. If arguing over the TV channel, take away TV privileges for that day. If they are arguing over who gets to sit in the front seat of the car, have them both to sit in the back seat. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Do Not Permit Hitting: </strong><ul><li>Clarify the Rule: &quot;No Hitting&quot;. This also applies to other types of physical fighting. </li><li>Remind them that disagreements can't be settled by hitting. </li><li>If your children are hurting each other, send them both to time-out in separate places. </li><li>Try to intervene at the shoving stage. </li><li>Don't waste time trying to figure out who took the first swing or provoked the fighting. </li><li>Don't ask questions or listen to accusations, just send them to time-out. </li><li>Do the same if they are putting property at risk. Have another rule &quot;No breaking things&quot;. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Do Not Permit Name Calling:</strong><ul><li>Clarify the Rule: &quot;No Name Calling&quot;. </li><li>Do not allow name calling or mean teasing. Here are some examples: calling a child who is not good in school a &quot;dummy&quot;, one who is not athletic &quot;clumsy&quot;, or one who has a bed-wetting problem &quot;smelly&quot;. Do not permit such hurtful comments because they cause emotional pain and can damage a child's self-esteem. </li><li>For name-calling, punishing that child alone makes sense.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop Any Arguing that Occurs in Public Places: </strong><ul><li>If you are in a shopping mall or restaurant and your children begin arguing, you need to stop them because it is annoying to other people. </li><li>If the arguing continues after a warning, separate them (for example, by sitting between them). </li><li>If that doesn't work, give them a brief time-out outside or at an out-of-the-way spot. </li><li>If your children are over age 4, you can warn them that they will lose a later activity, such as video time at home. </li><li>Sometimes you will need to leave the public setting and take your children home.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Protect Each Child's Personal Possessions and Friendships:</strong> <ul><li>When children argue over a toy and the toy belongs to one of the children, return it to the owner. A child doesn't have to share his possessions. Warn him, however, that some time he may want to play with his sister's toy and want her to share.</li><li>Teach your children to take turns playing with family toys such as video games or board games.</li><li>Also, teach your child to share toys when friends come over. Sharing is a needed skill for making and keeping friends and getting along in school.</li><li>Younger siblings often intrude on older siblings' friendships and play. It is helpful if you give the younger sibling a playmate or special activity when your older child has a friend over.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give Group Consequences:</strong> <ul><li>All punishment for arguing or fighting must be a group consequence. Send both to their room. Cancel screen time or other privileges for both.</li><li>Rivalry will become intense if a parent shows favoritism. Do not take sides. Do not compare them and do not label one as the troublemaker. Do not listen to any tattle-telling.</li><li>If one of your children complains that you are not being fair, restate the rule that has been broken. Also, restate the goal that they learn to get along together.</li><li>If you are feeling guilty, remind yourself that being a parent is difficult, but any mistakes you make will balance out.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give Group Praise:</strong><ul><li>Whenever you see your children playing together in a friendly way, praise them both. </li><li>Compliment them for helping each other and settling disagreements politely.</li></ul></div>\n",

A cold infects the lining of the nose. It also infects the lining of all the sinuses. Nasal and sinus congestion occur together.</li><li><strong>Bacterial Sinus Infection.</strong> A problem when a sinus becomes blocked and infected with bacteria. This occurs in 2% of colds. It starts as a viral sinus infection. Main symptoms are increased sinus pain or return of fever. Thick nasal secretions that last over 14 days may point to a sinus infection.</li><li><strong>Allergic Sinus Reaction.</strong> Sinus congestion often occurs with nasal allergies (such as from pollen). Sneezing, itchy nose and clear nasal discharge point to this cause.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Treatment of Sinus Congestion</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Viral Sinus Infection.</strong> Nasal washes with saline. Antibiotics are not helpful.</li><li><strong>Bacterial Sinus Infection.</strong> Antibiotics by mouth are needed.</li><li><strong>Allergic Sinus Reaction.</strong> Treatment with allergy medicines helps the nose and sinus symptoms.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Color of Nasal Discharge with Colds</strong></p><ul><li>The nasal discharge changes color during different stages of a cold. This is normal.</li><li>It starts as a clear discharge and later becomes cloudy.</li><li>Sometimes it becomes yellow or green colored for a few days. This is still normal for a cold.</li><li>Thick colored discharge points to bacterial sinusitis ONLY if it occurs with other symptoms. These are:</li><li>Sinus pain (not just sinus congestion) OR</li><li>Swelling or redness over any sinus OR</li><li>Return of a fever after it has been gone for over 24 hours OR</li><li>Thick nasal discharge lasts over 14 days without improvement.</li></ul>\n",

It usually clears up on its own.</li><li>Usually, nasal washes can prevent a bacterial sinus infection.</li><li>Antibiotics are not helpful for the sinus congestion that occurs with colds.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Fluids:</strong><ul><li>Try to get your child to drink lots of fluids.</li><li>Goal: Keep your child well hydrated.</li><li>It will thin out the mucus discharge from the nose. Also, it loosens up any phlegm in the lungs. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Nasal Saline to Open a Blocked Nose:</strong><ul><li>Use saline (salt water) nose drops or spray to loosen up the dried mucus. If you don't have saline, you can use a few drops of bottled water or clean tap water. Teens can just splash a little tap water in the nose and then blow.</li><li>STEP 1: Put 3 drops in each nostril.</li><li>STEP 2: Blow each nostril out while closing off the other nostril.</li><li>STEP 3: Repeat nose drops and blowing until the discharge is clear.</li><li>How often: Do nasal saline when your child can't breathe through the nose.</li><li>Saline nose drops or spray can be bought in any drugstore. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Saline nose drops can also be made at home. Use 1/2 teaspoon (2 ml) of table salt. Stir the salt into 1 cup (8 ounces or 240 ml) of clean water. You must use bottled or boiled water for this purpose.</li><li>Reason for nose drops: Blowing alone can't remove dried or sticky mucus.</li><li>Other option. Use a warm shower to loosen mucus. Breathe in moist air, then blow each nostril.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Humidifier:</strong><ul><li>If the air in your home is dry, use a humidifier. Reason: Dry air makes nasal mucus thicker.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Decongestant Nose Spray (No prescription needed):</strong><ul><li>Use this only if the sinus still seems blocked up after nasal washes. Also, only use for age 12 years or older. Use the long-acting type such as Afrin.</li><li>Dose: 1 spray on each side. Do this 2 times per day.</li><li>Always clean out the nose before using.</li><li>Use for 1 day. After that, use only for symptoms.</li><li>Don't use for more than 3 days. (Reason: Can cause rebound congestion).</li><li>Oral decongestants (such as Sudafed) are not advised for children. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Fever:</strong><ul><li>For fevers above 102° F (39° C), give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Note: Lower fevers are important for fighting infections.</li><li>For ALL fevers: Keep your child well hydrated. Give lots of cold fluids.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Pain Medicine:</strong><ul><li>To help with the pain, give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Allergy Medicine:</strong><ul><li>If the child also has nasal allergies, give an allergy medicine.</li><li>Long-acting allergy medicines are a good first choice. Examples are Zyrtec, Allegra or Claritin. Reason: These meds do not cause your child to act sleepy. To save money, purchase the store brand.</li><li>Benadryl can be used if these products do not control symptoms. </li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>With this advice, viral sinus congestion goes away in 7 to 14 days.</li><li>The main risk is a sinus infection from bacteria. This can occur if bacteria multiply within a blocked sinus. This leads to a fever and increased pain. A bacterial sinus infection will need antibiotics.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return to School:</strong><ul><li>Sinus infections cannot be spread to others.</li><li>Your child can return to school after the fever is gone.</li><li>Your child should feel well enough to join in normal activities.</li></ul></div>\n",

They are well rested.</li><li>Early morning risers are not waking early on purpose. They are no longer tired. They've been put to bed too early the night before, had too many naps, or had a nap that was too long.</li><li>Some children also just need less sleep than the average child. Such children often have a parent who needs only 6 hours or so of sleep at night.</li><li>A smaller group of children are not well rested. They wake up early because of a bad habit that has developed. They are allowed to go back to sleep in the parent's bed, eat breakfast or watch videos at 5 AM. Since they are still tired, they fall back to sleep again within an hour. These habits may persist even after the original cause of too long a nap is removed.</li></ul>\n",

Set the timer for 6 AM. Tell him he can't leave his bedroom until the light comes on.</li><li>Other gadgets: You could also plug a video or music playing device into a timer. </li><li>Tell him he can play quietly until then. Help him put out special toys or books the night before.</li><li>Also, tell your child, &quot;It's not polite to wake up someone who is sleeping, unless you are sick or it's an emergency. Grownups need sleep too.&quot;</li></ul></div><div><strong>Remove any Bad Habits that are Present:</strong><ul><li>Don't allow any eating, screen time, or fun time in your bed before 6 AM.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Keep in Bedroom Until 6 AM If Sleeps in Regular Bed:</strong><ul><li>If he comes out of his room, take him back quickly but in a loving way.</li><li>If he comes out again, close the bedroom door. Tell him you can open it as soon as he's in bed. Every 10 minutes or so, open the door. In a loving way, ask him if he's ready to stay in bed now.</li><li>If this is a chronic problem, consider putting up a gate the night before.</li><li>If less than 3 years, consider putting him back in the crib for a few nights.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Leave In Crib Until 6 AM if Sleeps in Crib:</strong><ul><li>Put some books or quiet toys in his crib the night before.</li><li>If he cries, go in once to reassure him and remind him of the toys. If he cries again, ignore it.

If your child has been awakening at 5 AM, help him wait until 5:15 for 3 days. Set a timer lamp for that time. After your child has adjusted to 5:15, change the timer to 5:30. Move the wakeup time forward every 3 or 4 days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Reward Good Behavior:</strong><ul><li>Give a treat for following the rule.</li><li>Praise your child for not waking other people in the morning.</li><li>A star chart or special treat at breakfast will help your child improve.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>If parents enforce the new rule, most children adapt within 4 to 7 days.</li><li>Expect some crying and protest during the transition. </li><li>Young children normally cry when they don't get their way. </li></ul></div>\n",

They cry for a parent to come help them return to sleep.</li><li>Here are some tips to help your baby become a really good sleeper.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Newborns - Help Your Baby Fall Asleep Using any Technique that Works:</strong><ul><li>During the first month of life, survival is the main agenda.</li><li>Gently rock your baby to sleep. Try humming, singing lullabies, or using white noise. Different babies respond to different calming techniques. Even if your baby falls asleep at the breast or bottle, you can fix that later.</li><li>Do not feed newborns more often than every 2 hours during the day. (Exception: the first week when breast milk is still coming in).</li><li>Crying does not always mean your baby is hungry. If your baby is tired but fussing, try gentle rocking to calm him. If that does not work, try swaddling him. For babies, swaddling is the next best thing to being hugged.</li><li>Do not let your baby sleep for more than 2 hours in a row during the day. Awaken him and feed him. Doing this helps your infant meet his calorie needs and sleep longer during the night.</li><li>Look after your sleep needs by sleeping when your baby sleeps.</li><li>Caution: The safe sleep position for healthy babies is on the back in a crib.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Place Your Baby in the Crib When He is Drowsy but Awake (starting at 2 months old):</strong> <ul><li>Then leave the room. Let your baby put himself to sleep.</li><li>It often takes 10-20 minutes of restlessness and fussiness for a baby to fall asleep. That's normal.</li><li>Common question: What to do if my baby starts crying?</li><li>Answer: Always respond to a crying baby.</li><li>First, try a soft voice and a few pats.</li><li>If that doesn't work, hold him until he calms down. Return him to the crib before he falls asleep.</li><li>Again, hold your baby for crying, not for normal fussiness.</li><li>Remember, all sleep training starts at sleep transitions.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Encourage Self-soothing Skills for Entering Sleep:</strong><ul><li>Don't become part of your baby's falling asleep transition. The sleep transition is the 10 minutes or so between acting sleepy (but the eyes are still open) and the moment the eyes close.</li><li>Don't hold or rock until asleep.</li><li>Don't feed until asleep.</li><li>Don't let your baby sleep in your bed.</li><li>Learning to fall asleep without you is very important. He needs that self-soothing skill to put himself back to sleep after normal wake-ups during the night.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Separate Feeding from Falling Asleep:</strong><ul><li>Make feeding the first step in the bedtime ritual, not the last step.</li><li>Feed in a separate room, not the crib room.</li><li>Interrupt the feeding if your baby starts to fall asleep.</li><li>Dozing on the breast is a common way that babies become poor sleepers.</li><li>Your baby's last waking memory needs to be of the crib and mattress, not of the breast or bottle.</li><li>The best sequence is feed, read, bedtime ritual, then put in crib.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Establish a Last Feeding Time at Your Bedtime:</strong> <ul><li>The longest a newborn can sleep is 4 or 5 hours.</li><li>And that only happens once during each day.</li><li>Awaken your baby at 10 or 11 PM for a last feed of the day.</li><li>Continue this last feeding time until your baby can sleep at least 7 straight hours. Reason: To give yourself one good block of sleep each day.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Let Your Baby Become a Grazer:</strong><ul><li>A grazer is a baby who is allowed to feed for any crying.</li><li>This is also called comfort nursing.</li><li>Grazers are never good sleepers at night.</li><li>Keep daytime feeding intervals to at least 2 hours.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Phase Out the Last Middle-of-the-night Feeding By 6 Months of Age:</strong><ul><li>Have 7-8 hours of consecutive sleep as a goal. Many formula fed babies reach it by 4 months.</li><li>By 2 months old, try to stretch daytime feedings to 3 hours apart.</li><li>By 4 months old, your baby should be down to 1 night-time feeding. And it should be at least 5 hours since he fell asleep at bedtime. If not, try to delay it.</li><li>By 5 months old, start trying to phase out the last night-time feeding. Gradually reduce the amount.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Use a Pacifier For Sleep:</strong><ul><li>Do not use a pacifier to help your baby fall asleep. </li><li>Keep the pacifier out of the crib.</li><li>Reason: It will become a bad habit. Your baby won't be able to fall asleep without it in his mouth. Then after normal awakenings at night, he can't fall back to sleep without the pacifier. Babies can't find their pacifier and put it back in their mouth until about 10 months old. So they will cry for you to come and find and re-insert it for them. That's how a pacifier turns into a sleep problem.</li><li>Use a pacifier to help calm your baby if they are crying. Use only if you are also holding them and before you put them in the crib.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Have Your Baby Sleep in Your Bed:</strong><ul><li>There are several reasons for having your baby sleep in a crib.</li><li>In the first 12 months, it can be harmful for your baby to sleep in an adult bed. The SIDS rate is more than 10 times higher.</li><li>Your baby does not need bed-sharing to be secure and happy.</li><li>It will become a bad habit that is hard to undo.</li><li>You probably won't get a good night's sleep.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Prevent Baby Bottle Tooth Decay:</strong><ul><li>Severe tooth decay is the most serious side effect of poor sleep training. </li><li>Never give your baby a bottle of milk or juice in the crib. Same goes for sippy cups. </li><li>The key is to separate feeding your baby from falling asleep. The best sequence is feed, read, bedtime ritual, then put in crib. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Keep Your Child in a Crib as Long as Possible: </strong><ul><li>Most toddlers like their crib and associate it with sleep.</li><li>If possible, keep them there until age 3. Reason: More self-control by then and less likely to try to leave their bedroom. </li><li>Cure any sleep problem long before your child leaves the crib. </li><li>Caution: If your child can climb out of the crib, put the mattress on the floor. Safety comes first.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Caution - Risk of Suffocation for Babies</strong></p><ul><li>During the first year of life, it can be harmful to sleep in the same bed with your baby.</li><li>If the adult mattress is soft, your baby can suffocate. In fact, the rate of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) for infants is 10 times higher for babies sleeping in an adult bed compared to a crib.</li><li>In addition, there are about 100 deaths per year in the U.S. from parents accidentally laying on and suffocating their children while sleeping. The risk is highest if one of the parents has a deep sleep disorder or sometimes drinks too much.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Co-sleeping: Pros and Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Sleeping in the same bed with your children (co-sleeping) is a parent decision, not a medical decision.</li><li>In general, bed-sharing is not recommended because it results in poor sleep for many parents.</li><li>Also, once begun, it's a hard habit to break.</li><li>So think carefully before you allow your child to start sharing your bed.</li><li>Here are some facts that will help you make an informed decision.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Benefits of Co-sleeping</strong></p><ul><li>No proven benefit for the child. Your child doesn't need to share your bed to be secure and happy. Children's fears and insecurities can be dealt with in other ways. Children turn out fine either way. In some countries, families share beds out of necessity, but most children in our country sleep happily in their own beds.</li><li>No proven benefit for the parents. Bed-sharing is not quality time. If your child is asleep in your bed, it is a neutral time. If your child is crying and keeping you awake, it is an aggravating time.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Harm of Co-sleeping</strong></p><ul><li>Proven harm to the child. Bed sharing can be dangerous for babies. Reason: risk of suffocation. After 12 months, there is no proven risk of harm. There is no evidence that bed-sharing produces children who are more spoiled or dependent.</li><li>Proven harm to parents. Several studies have shown that more than half of the children who sleep with their parents resist going to bed and awaken several times during the night.</li><li>Co-sleeping children always want to stay up as late as their parents do. If you want your child's bedtime to be earlier, you may need to lie down with your child for 30 to 60 minutes to get them to sleep.</li><li>Since many children are restless sleepers and move around a lot during the night, parents who sleep with them don't get a good night's sleep and become sleep deprived. Sleeping with your child is a bad choice if you are a light sleeper and you need your sleep to perform well during the day.</li><li>Co-sleeping potentially can be harmful to the marriage. This mainly occurs if the parents disagree about this arrangement, and one of the parents (usually the father) becomes displaced to another room.</li><li>Bed-sharing is never a long-term solution to sleep problems. Your child will not learn to sleep well in your bed and then decide on his own to start sleeping in his own bed. With every passing month, this habit becomes harder to break. Your child can no longer sleep alone. Most co-sleepers do not become cooperative about sleeping in their own bed until age 6 - 8 years.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"> </p><p class=\"rteBlock\"> </p>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Sleep in Same Room, but Not Same Bed:</strong><ul><li>Sleeping in the same room, but not the same bed, is a better plan.</li><li>Let your baby sleep in your bedroom until he doesn't need a middle of the night feed. Most normal infants can sleep 7 consecutive hours without feeding by 6 months of life.</li><li>Then move his crib to a separate room, if possible.</li><li>If you must sleep in the same room with your older infant, don't allow him to see you during his normal awakenings. If he does, it is an invitation to play. Use a screen or a cover over the side of the crib.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Encourage a Security Object at 6 Months of Age:</strong><ul><li>After 6 months of age, encourage a soft toy or stuffed animal as a security object. Otherwise, he may want you as his security object.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Use a Safe Sleep Position for Infants (on their backs):</strong><ul><li>The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends that infants sleep on their back in a crib during the first year of life.</li><li>This has reduced the SIDS rate by 60% in the U.S.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Types of Baby Foods</strong></p><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Cereals</strong></p><ul><li>Cereals are usually the first solid food added to your baby's diet. The main reason is they are easy to digest. Babies only getting breast milk also can develop anemia from low iron. This is prevented by starting cereal at 6 months. Most baby cereals are iron-fortified.</li><li>Mix the cereal with breast milk or formula. The cereal mixture needs to be a semi-liquid. It can be mixed a little thicker as your baby becomes better at swallowing it.</li><li>Cereals should be fed with a small spoon. Don't mix cereal in the baby's bottle. This is because an infant should be taught to differentiate between what he eats and what he drinks.</li><li>Start with rice, barley or oatmeal cereal. A mixed cereal should be added to your baby's diet only after each kind of cereal in the mixed cereal has been tried separately.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Vegetables and Fruits</strong></p><ul><li>Next, introduce strained or pureed vegetables and fruits to your baby. The order in which you add these foods to your baby's diet is not important.</li><li>However, introduce only one new food at a time.</li><li>Try to wait 3 days before starting another new food. That way if your baby develops diarrhea, you will know what may have caused it.</li><li>For all babies, introduce pure vegetable baby foods (no added fruit) before 9 months. Reason: may prevent later dislike of vegetables and bitter tastes.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Meats and High Protein Foods</strong></p><ul><li>Next give strained or pureed meats. Other protein-rich foods include eggs, beans and peas. These solids can add to your infant's iron intake.</li><li>Yogurt and cheese are also good protein sources (but low iron).</li><li>Meats should definitely be added by 8 months at the latest. (Except for vegans)</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Homemade Baby Foods</strong></p><ul><li>Between 8 and 12 months of age, introduce your baby to mashed table foods. They contain small chunks. They are called stage 3 foods or junior foods.</li><li>You can make your own baby foods if you want. Use a baby-food grinder or regular blender. Be sure to add enough water to get a consistency that your baby can easily swallow.</li><li>For individual portions, you can pour these homemade baby foods into ice cube trays and freeze them. Then remove them and store them in plastic freezer bags. Defrost them and serve as needed.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Baby Food by Texture</strong></p><ul><li>Stage 1 baby foods are pureed, smooth, runny foods. They are also single ingredient.</li><li>Stage 2 baby foods are creamy but thicker in texture. They may also contain multiple ingredients such as mixed fruits or mixed veggies.</li><li>Stage 3 baby foods contain some bits or chunks of food. They are comparable to mashed up table foods.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Preventing Food Allergies by Early Introduction of High Risk Foods</strong></p><ul><li>The advice for preventing food allergies has changed in recent years. (AAP).</li><li>Older advice: avoid high risk foods such as eggs until 2 years. Avoid peanut butter and fish/shellfish until 3 years. Research has shown that was bad advice.</li><li>Current advice: Early introduction of these foods reduces the risk of food allergies. For example: early introduction of peanut butter puffs reduces peanut allergy by 90%.</li><li>Current advice: High risk foods can be started after 6 months of age. Eggs and fish can be mashed up. A small amount of smooth peanut butter can be mixed in with normal baby foods. Better yet, give them as peanut butter puffs.</li><li>Introduce other solid foods like cereals first for a few weeks.</li><li>Add new foods one at a time. Try to wait 3 days before starting another.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Foods to Avoid for Babies</strong></p><ul><li>Honey: Never give your child honey during the first year of life. Reason: It can rarely cause infant botulism, a muscle weakness disease.</li><li>Cow's milk (whole milk): Avoid during the first year of life. Reason: in some babies it can cause anemia. Cow's milk formulas are fine.</li><li>Choking on Foods: Avoid any foods your child might choke on. Some high-risk foods are grapes and hot dogs. These may block the airway and cause sudden death. Raw vegetables (such as carrots) and peanuts should be avoided until 4 years old. Reason: Young children can't chew them and they could be inhaled into the lungs. Also avoid large pieces of any sticky food (such as peanut butter). </li><li>Heavy metals in trace amounts are found in the foods we eat. That includes some baby foods. The tiny amounts eaten are harmless.They can't be completely avoided. Reason: Heavy metals are normally present in the soil and water. They are absorbed by plants and get into the food chain. (AAP)</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Iron Rich Foods</strong></p><ul><li>Throughout our lives we need iron in our diet to prevent anemia. Certain foods are especially good sources of iron. Red meats, fish, and poultry are best.</li><li>Some young children will only eat lunch meats, such as ham slices.</li><li>Adequate iron is also found in iron-enriched cereals and beans of all types. Egg yolks, peanut butter, raisins, and other dried fruits are iron rich. Other good foods are plum juice and dark leafy greens.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Vitamins: When They Are Needed</strong></p><ul><li>Formula fed babies get all the vitamins they need from the formula.</li><li>Breast-fed babies need a vitamin D supplement. Start 400 units per day at 2 weeks of age. You can buy Vitamin D drops in most drug stores.</li><li>After your child is 1 and eating a balanced diet, added vitamins are usually not needed.</li><li>If your child is a picky eater, give him 1 chewable vitamin pill. Do this at least twice a week. Gummy vitamins are not as helpful. Reason: They contain all the vitamins, but not the minerals.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Baby Foods: When to Start</strong> <ul><li>Breast milk and formulas meet all of your baby's nutritional needs until 6 months or longer. Introducing strained foods earlier just makes feeding more complicated.</li><li>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months. Wait until then to start baby foods. </li><li>For formula fed infants, the AAP recommends starting baby foods around 6 months of age.</li><li>For breastfed babies, move on to more iron-enriched baby foods before 7 months.</li><li>For all babies, introduce pure vegetable baby foods (no added fruit) before 9 months. Reason: may prevent later dislike of vegetables and bitter tastes. </li><li>Which baby foods you start first is not important. Just introduce one new food at a time.</li><li>Try to wait 3 days in between starting another new baby food.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Spoon Feeding: When to Start</strong><ul><li>Do not start spoon feeding until your baby has the following physical skills:</li><li>Can sit with some support in a high chair or feeding seat.</li><li>Can hold his head steady. Has strong neck muscles and good head support.</li><li>Knows to open the mouth at the sight of food.</li></ul></div><div><strong>How to Spoon Feed:</strong><ul><li>Teaching your baby to take food off a spoon and swallow it will take some time. </li><li>Use a small baby spoon. </li><li>Put the spoon just inside the mouth. Wait for your baby to close his mouth around it.</li><li>Then slowly pull the spoon straight out while he sucks the food off the spoon. The upper lip and sucking will keep most of the food inside. </li><li>You may need to add a little extra milk to make it thinner and easier to suck. </li><li>Some need to drink a little milk first to take the edge off their appetite.</li><li>Some children constantly bat at the spoon. Others try to hold it while you are trying to feed them. These children need to be distracted. Use finger foods or give them another spoon to play with.</li><li>By 15 to 18 months of age, most children can use a spoon on their own. They no longer need your help to eat. The spoon now belongs to them.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Avoid Gagging:</strong><ul><li>Gagging means you need to slow down. Give smoother foods or smaller amounts. It may mean that you need to delay starting solids. </li><li>Most babies need to be 6 months old before they can easily swallow purees.</li><li>Gagging is a protective reflex. It keeps food from getting into the airway. It prevents choking.</li></ul></div><div><strong>How Much to Give:</strong><ul><li>Start with a small amount on the spoon. At first your baby may just want a taste. Then gradually work up to larger portions. </li><li>During the first year, 2 to 4 tablespoons (1 to 2 ounces) of each kind of food per meal is common. </li><li>If your child is still hungry after finishing that amount, serve her more.</li><li>If your baby doesn't like a new food, stop. You can tell because she spits it out. She may also refuse to open her mouth after a taste. Don't offer that food again for a few weeks. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Finger Foods: When and How to Start</strong><ul><li>Finger foods are small, bite-size pieces of soft foods.</li><li>They can be introduced when your child develops a pincer grip. That means the ability to pick objects up between the thumb and first finger. A pincher grip usually develops between 9 and 10 months.</li><li>Most babies love to feed themselves. Most babies will not be able to feed themselves with a spoon until 15 months. Finger foods are the way to keep your baby actively involved in the feeding process.</li><li>Favorite finger foods are dry cereals (Cheerios, Rice Krispies, etc.). Others are small pieces of soft cheese or scrambled eggs. Canned fruit (peaches or pears) or fresh bananas are also good if cut into small pieces. Other choices are crackers, cookies, and breads. Be sure to include peanut-flavored Cheerios or puffs.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Snacks: When to Start </strong><ul><li>Once your baby goes to 3 main meals a day, he may need a small snack.  This will help tide him over between meals. </li><li>Most babies begin this pattern between 6 and 9 months of age. </li><li>The midmorning and midafternoon snack should be a nutritious, non-milk food. </li><li>Fruits and dry cereals are recommended. </li><li>If your child is not hungry at mealtime, cut back on the snacks or eliminate them.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Table Foods: When to Start</strong> <ul><li>Your child should be eating the same meals you eat by about 1 year.</li><li>This assumes that your diet is a well-balanced one. Avoid added salt.</li><li>Carefully dice any foods that would be difficult for your baby to chew.</li><li>Mash up some foods with a fork.</li><li>Avoid foods that he could choke on. Foods such as raw carrots, candy, peanuts, and popcorn should be avoided.</li></ul></div>\n",

Infants with this condition cry numerous times per day. They also act very unhappy when they are not crying. They are in almost constant discomfort. These are the refluxers who can be helped by acid blocking drugs.</li><li>Most excessive crying is caused by colic, not reflux</li></ul>\n",

It improves with age.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Feed Smaller Amounts:</strong><ul><li>Skip this advice if age less than 1 month or not gaining weight well.</li><li><strong>Bottlefed Babies.</strong> Give smaller amounts per feeding (1 ounce or 30 ml less than you have been). Keep the total feeding time to less than 20 minutes. Reason: Overfeeding or completely filling the stomach always makes spitting up worse.</li><li><strong>Breastfed Babies. </strong>If you have a good milk supply, try nursing on 1 side per feeding. Pump the other side. Switch sides you start on at each feeding.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Longer Time Between Feedings:</strong> <ul><li><strong>Formula.</strong> Wait at least 2½ hours between feedings.</li><li><strong>Breastmilk.</strong> Wait at least 2 hours between feedings.</li><li>Reason: It takes that long for the stomach to empty itself. Don't add more milk to a full stomach.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Loose Diapers: </strong><ul><li>Do not put the diaper on too tight. It puts added pressure on the stomach.</li><li>Don't put pressure on the stomach right after meals.</li><li>Also, do not play too hard with your baby during this time.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Upright Position:</strong> <ul><li>After meals, try to hold your baby in the upright (vertical) position.</li><li>Use a front-pack, backpack, or swing for 30 to 60 minutes after feedings.</li><li>Decrease the time in a sitting position (such as infant seats).</li><li>After 6 months of age, a jumpy seat is helpful. The newer ones are stable.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Less Pacifier Time: </strong><ul><li>Frequent sucking on a pacifier can pump the stomach up with swallowed air.</li><li>So can sucking on a bottle with too small a nipple hole.</li><li>The formula should drip 1 drop per second when held upside down. If it doesn't, the nipple hole may be clogged. Clean the nipple better. You can also make the nipple hole slightly bigger.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Burping:</strong> <ul><li>Burping is less important than giving smaller feedings. You can burp your baby 2 or 3 times during each feeding.</li><li>Do it when he pauses and looks around. Don't interrupt his feeding rhythm in order to burp him.</li><li>Burp for less than a minute. Stop even if no burp occurs. Some babies don't need to burp.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Add Baby Cereal to Formula:</strong><ul><li>If your baby still spits up large amounts, try thickening the formula. Mix it with a baby cereal.</li><li>Start with 1 level teaspoon of cereal to each ounce of formula.</li><li>Oatmeal baby cereal is best. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Acid Blocking Medicines: </strong><ul><li>Prescription medicines that block acid production are not helpful for normal reflux. </li><li>These medicines also can have side effects. </li><li>They do not reduce excessive crying from colic.</li><li>They are only useful for symptoms of heartburn.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect: </strong><ul><li>Reflux gets better with age. </li><li>After learning to sit well, many babies are better by 7 months of age.</li></ul></div>\n",

Reason: Can cause swelling of the splinter.</li><li>Use the needle to uncover the large end of the sliver. Use good lighting. A magnifying glass may help.</li><li>Grasp the end firmly with the tweezers. Pull it out at the same angle that it went in. Get a good grip the first time. This is important for slivers that go straight into the skin. This is also important for those trapped under the fingernail.</li><li>For slivers under a fingernail, sometimes part of the nail must be cut away. Use a fine scissors to expose the end of the sliver.</li><li>Slivers (where you can see all of it) often can be removed at home. Pull on the end. If the end breaks off, open the skin with a sterile needle. Go along the length of the sliver and flick it out.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Antibiotic Ointment:</strong><ul><li>Wash the area with soap and water before and after removal.</li><li>Use an antibiotic ointment once after sliver is taken out. An example is Polysporin. No prescription is needed. This will help to decrease the risk of infection.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 1": "<ul><li>You feel your child is spoiled or out of control</li><li>You and your partner often disagree on discipline</li><li>Following rules is not improved after tightening up on your discipline plan for 8 weeks</li><li>You have other questions or concerns</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"> </p>\n",
      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Causes</strong></p><ul><li>The main cause of spoiled children is a lenient, permissive parenting style. Permissive parents at the extreme may not set any limits or boundaries. If parents give a child too much power, the child will become spoiled. Such parents also rescue the child from normal frustrations. Sometimes a child is cared for by a nanny or sitter who spoils the child by providing constant entertainment and by giving in to unrealistic demands.</li><li>The reason some parents are too lenient is that they don't want to hurt their child's feelings or hear him cry. They may choose the short-term solution of doing whatever stops the crying, which in the long run, causes more protest crying. Keep in mind that enforcing normal rules often triggers some crying.</li><li>The difference between giving children the attention they need and spoiling them may be unclear. In general, attention is good for children. However, it can become harmful if it is excessive, given at the wrong time, or always given immediately. Attention from a parent is excessive if it interferes with a child's learning to do things for himself and dealing with life's normal frustrations. Giving attention when you are busy because your child demands it is an example of giving attention at the wrong time. Another example is giving attention when a child is throwing a tantrum and needs to be ignored. Finally, if attention is always given immediately, your child won't learn to wait.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><ul><li>Spoiled children run into trouble by the time they reach school age. Other children do not like them because they are too bossy and selfish. Adults do not like them because they are rude and make excessive demands. Eventually, spoiled children become hard for even their parents to love because of their behavior.</li><li>Because they don't get along well with other children and adults, spoiled children eventually become unhappy. They may show decreased motivation and perseverance in their school work. There is also an association with increased risk-taking behaviors during adolescence, such as substance abuse.</li><li>In summary, spoiling a child prepares a child poorly for life in the real world. Don't let this happen to your child.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"> </p><p class=\"rteBlock\"> </p>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Provide Age-Appropriate Limits and Rules for Your Child: </strong><ul><li>Parents have the responsibility to take charge and make rules. </li><li>Age-appropriate discipline can begin at the age of crawling. Hearing &quot;no&quot; occasionally is good for children. </li><li>Children need external controls until they develop self-control and self-discipline. </li><li>Your child will still love you if you say &quot;no&quot; to him. If your kids like you all the time, you're not being a good parent.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Require Cooperation with Important Rules: </strong><ul><li>Your child must learn to cooperate with your directions long before he starts school. </li><li>First, rules are needed for safety, such as staying in the car seat. </li><li>Second, rules are needed to prevent aggressive behaviors, such as &quot;no hitting&quot;. </li><li>Then other important rules are needed for normal family functioning. Examples are being ready to leave on time in the morning and going to bed on time. </li><li>These adult decisions are not open to negotiation. Do not give your child a choice when there is none.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Expect Your Child to Cry:</strong> <ul><li>Crying can have many causes. Important crying can relate to pain, hunger and fear. Respond to painful crying immediately. Feed for hunger. Comfort for fears.</li><li>Crying is also a normal response to change or frustration. This common type of protest crying is harmless.</li><li>When crying is part of a tantrum, ignore it. There are times when you will have to withhold comforting temporarily to help your child learn something that is important. For example, he can't pull on your earrings.</li><li>Don't punish your child for crying or tell him he shouldn't cry. Avoid denying him his feelings, but don't be moved by his normal protest crying.</li><li>Offset this unhappy crying when you are tightening up on the rules by providing extra cuddling and hugs when he is not crying or having a tantrum.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Do Not Allow Tantrums to Work: </strong><ul><li>Children throw temper tantrums to get your attention, to wear you down, to get you to change your mind, and to get their own way. Tantrums are an attempt to change your &quot;no&quot; to a &quot;yes&quot;. </li><li>Tantrums may include whining, complaining, crying, breath-holding, pounding the floor, shouting, or slamming a door. </li><li>As long as your child stays in one place and is not at risk for harming himself, you can safely ignore him during a tantrum. </li><li>By all means, don't give in to tantrums.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Overlook Discipline During Quality Time: </strong><ul><li>If you are a working parent, you will want to spend part of your free time each day with your child. </li><li>This time needs to be enjoyable, but also reality-based. </li><li>Don't ease up on the house rules. If your child misbehaves, remind him of the rules and follow-through. </li><li>Even during fun activities, you need to enforce your rules.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Try to Reason or Negotiate with Young Children:</strong> <ul><li>Don't give away your power as a parent. Children need rules and structure to develop self-discipline.</li><li>Toddlers don't play by the rules. Young children respond to action much more than words. By age 4, your child will begin to understand the reason behind your rules. But not until age 6 are they likely to be able to discuss and contribute to the rules.</li><li>The more democratic a parent is during a child's early years, the more demanding the child tends to become. In general, young children don't know what to do with power. Left to their own devices, they usually spoil themselves. If they are testing everything at age 3, it is not normal and needs help.</li><li>If you have given away your power, take it back. Set new limits and enforce them. You don't have to give a reason for every rule. Sometimes it is just because &quot;that's the rule.&quot;</li></ul></div><div><strong>Teach Your Child to Cope with Boredom: </strong><ul><li>Your job is to provide toys, books, and art supplies. Your child's job is to use them. Assuming you talk and play with your young child a few hours each day, you do not need to be his constant playmate. Nor do you need to always provide him with an outside friend.</li><li>When you're busy, expect your child to amuse himself. Even 1-year-olds can keep themselves occupied for 15 minutes at a time. By age 3, most children can entertain themselves about half of the time. </li><li>Sending your child off to &quot;find something to do&quot; is doing him a favor. Much creative play, thinking, and daydreaming come from coping with boredom. </li><li>If you can't seem to resign as social director, consider enrolling your child in a play group or preschool.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Teach Your Child to Wait:</strong> <ul><li>Waiting helps children learn to deal with normal frustration. All adult work carries some degree of frustration.</li><li>Delaying immediate gratification is something your child must learn slowly. It also takes practice.</li><li>Don't feel guilty if you have to make your child wait a few minutes now and then. For example, when you are talking with others in person or on the telephone, they need to find something else to do.</li><li>Waiting doesn't hurt a child as long as it isn't excessive. His emotional fitness will benefit.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Rescue Your Child from Normal life Challenges: </strong><ul><li>Changes such as moving and starting school are normal life stressors. These are opportunities for learning and problem solving. </li><li>Always be available and supportive, but don't help your child with situations he can handle by himself. </li><li>Overall, make your child's life as realistic as he can tolerate for his age, rather than going out of your way to make it as pleasant as possible. His coping skills and self-confidence will benefit.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Overpraise Your Child:</strong> <ul><li>Children need praise, but it can be overdone.</li><li>Praise your child for specific behavior (&quot;good job&quot;), not for &quot;being good&quot;. Also praise for effort (&quot;See what you can do when you try hard.&quot;) Encourage him to try new things and do his best.</li><li>Praise him for completing tasks, not every step of the way. Praise him especially for projects he started on his own. Self-confidence and real self-esteem come from personal accomplishments.</li><li>Giving your child constant attention can make him praise-dependent and more demanding.</li><li>Resist the tendency (especially common with the first-born) to overpraise your child's normal development.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Teach Your Child That Adults Also Have Rights: </strong><ul><li>A child's needs for love, food, clothing, safety, and security obviously come first. However, your needs (such as for sleep and partner time) are also important. Your child's wants (for example, for more play or an extra bedtime story) should come after your needs are met and as time allows. This is especially important for working parents where family time is limited.</li><li>Quality time is time that is enjoyable, interactive, and focused on your child. Children need some quality time with their parents every day. But spending every free moment of your evenings and weekends with your child is not good for you or your child. You need a balance to preserve your mental health. </li><li>Scheduled nights out with your partner or friends will not only nurture your adult relationships, but also help you to return to parenting with more to give. </li><li>Your child needs to learn to accept separations from his parent. </li><li>If he isn't taught to respect your rights, he may not learn to respect the rights of other adults.</li></ul></div>\n",

Infants and Sunscreens:</strong></p><ul><li>The skin of infants is thinner than the skin of older children. It is more sensitive to the sun.</li><li>Sun avoidance is best for children under 6 months. Stay in the shade.</li><li>Sun avoidance or sun proof clothing is best for children 6 months to 3 years. That means clothes that fully cover the arms and legs. Also, have your child wear a hat with a brim.</li><li>When a sunscreen is needed, infants can use adult sunscreens. The FDA hasn't approved their use under 6 months old. However, the AAP supports their use at this age. There are no reported harmful side effects from today's sunscreens.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>3. Protect Lips, Nose and Eyes:</strong></p><ul><li>To prevent sunburned lips, apply a lip coating that contains sunscreen.</li><li>If the nose or some other area has been burned often, use zinc oxide or titanium oxide ointment.</li><li>Protect your child's eyes with good sunglasses. Reason: Prevent future cataracts.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>4. Time of Day:</strong></p><ul><li>Avoid exposure to the sun during the hours of 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Reason: Sun's rays most intense.</li><li>Caution: When overcast, over 70% of the sun's rays still get through the clouds.</li></ul>\n",

      "HTML Column 1": "<ul><li>Your child has hurt himself or others during tantrums</li><li>Tantrums occur 3 or more times per day</li><li>Tantrums also occur at school</li><li>Your child has many other behavior problems</li><li>One of the parents has tantrums or screaming bouts and can't give them up</li><li>Tantrums are not better after using this plan for 4 weeks</li><li>You have other questions or concerns</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"> </p>\n",
      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Causes</strong></p><ul><li>A tantrum is an immature way of expressing emotions, especially when feeling frustrated and angry. Toddlers don't have the verbal skills to put their feelings into words. They don't have much impulse control. They don't have the ability to pause and self-calm. No matter how calm and gentle a parent you are, your child will probably throw some tantrums. The triggers for tantrums are many.</li><li>All tantrums become more likely if your child is hungry, tired or sick. If you suspect hunger, give your child a snack. If your child is exhausted, put him down for a nap.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><ul><li>The peak age for normal tantrums is between 2 and 3 years.</li><li>By school age, temper tantrums should be uncommon.</li><li>By adolescence, they should be rare. Your teenager can be reminded that blowing up creates a bad impression. Teach coping skills such as deep slow breathing or counting to 10 to regain control.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Help Your Child Put Feelings into Words:</strong><ul><li>Before a tantrum, try to put what your child is feeling into words. Let him know that you understand why he is angry. For example, &quot;You feel angry because...&quot; We need to teach children that anger is normal. But it needs to be managed appropriately.</li><li>Praise your child when he controls his temper and verbally expresses his anger.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Teach Your Child That Temper Tantrums Don't Work:</strong> <ul><li>Teach that you don't change your mind or give in because of them.</li><li>Stay calm and speak in a soft voice. Be a good role model.</li><li>Avoid screaming at your child or having an adult tantrum.</li><li>Figure out what has triggered your child's outburst. Usually that is easy.</li><li>There are 6 different types of temper tantrums. One may match the tantrum your child is having. Each type is followed by a response that should help you deal with tantrum.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Frustration-Related Tantrums - Support Your Child: </strong><ul><li>Children often have temper tantrums when they are frustrated with their limitations. They may be frustrated because they can't put something together. Young children may be frustrated because their parents don't understand their speech. Older children may be frustrated with their inability to do their homework.</li><li>At these times, your child needs encouragement and a parent who listens. Put an arm around him and say something that shows understanding such as, &quot;I know it's hard, but you'll get better at it. Is there anything I can do to help you?&quot; Also, give praise for not giving up. </li><li>Prevention: Some of these tantrums can be prevented by steering your child away from tasks that he can't do well.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Demanding-Type Tantrums - Ignore Them:</strong><ul><li>Young children often throw temper tantrums to get their way. They may want to go with you rather than be left with the sitter. They want a cookie, to empty a desk drawer, or to go outside in bad weather. As long as your child stays in one place and is not too disruptive, you can leave him alone.</li><li>Tell your child you understand how he feels. &quot;You're mad because you want a cookie. But it's almost dinner time&quot;. And don't give in to your child's demands.</li><li>During the temper tantrum, if his behavior is harmless, ignore it completely. Once a tantrum has started, it rarely can be stopped. Move away, even to a different room. Then your child no longer has an audience. Nothing you can do will help.</li><li>Don't try to reason with your child during a tantrum. That will only make it last longer. Simply state, &quot;I can see you're very angry. I'll leave you alone until you calm down. Let me know if you want to talk.&quot;</li><li>Don't scold your child during a tantrum. That will make it get worse.</li><li>Your child has to calm down and regain control on his own. </li><li>After the tantrum, be friendly and try to return things to normal.</li><li>Prevention: If you recognize that a certain event is going to push your child over the edge, try to shift his attention to something else. You can prevent some of these tantrums by saying &quot;No&quot; less often.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Refusal-Type Tantrums - Gently Move Your Child: </strong><ul><li>If your child refuses something unimportant (such as cleaning up his toys), let it go before a tantrum begins. However, if your child must do something important, such as go to bed or to child care, he should not be able to avoid it by having a tantrum.</li><li>Once a tantrum has begun, let your child have the tantrum for 2 or 3 minutes. Try to put his unhappiness into words: &quot;You want to play some more, but it's bedtime.&quot; </li><li>Then take him to the intended destination (for example, the bed). Help him as much as is needed (including carrying). </li><li>Prevention: Some of these tantrums can be prevented by giving your child a 5-minute warning instead of telling him suddenly to stop what he is doing.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Screaming-Type Tantrums - Give a Time-out:</strong><ul><li>Screaming is a super-duper tantrum performed by a child with exceptional vocal cords and lungs. </li><li>Clarify the Rule: &quot;No screaming in our house&quot;. Some tantrums are too disruptive for parents to ignore. On such occasions, send or take your child to his bedroom for 2 to 5 minutes. </li><li>Examples of disruptive behavior include:</li><li>Screaming or yelling that won't stop with ignoring it.</li><li>Clinging to you or following you when you try to go to another room.</li><li>Having a tantrum in a public place such as a restaurant or church. Move your child to another place for his time-out. That could be outside or even in your car with supervision. The rights of other people need to be honored.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Aggressive-Type Tantrums - Give a Time-out:</strong> <ul><li>Harmful behavior should never be ignored. On such occasions send or take your child to his room for 2 to 5 minutes. Examples of aggressive behavior include:</li><li>Hitting, kicking or biting you.</li><li>Throwing objects or damaging property during a temper tantrum.</li><li>Doing something dangerous to himself such as running away.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Rage-Type Tantrums - Hold Your Child:</strong> <ul><li>If your child is totally out of control and screaming wildly, consider holding him. His loss of control probably scares him. Also, hold your child when he is having tantrums that carry a danger of self-injury (such as if he is violently throwing himself backward).</li><li>Take your child in your arms, tell him you know he is upset, and give him your calmness. Hold him until you feel his body start to relax. This usually takes 1 to 3 minutes. Then let him go. This comforting response is rarely needed after 3 years of age.</li><li>Some children won't want you to comfort them. Hold your child only if it helps. If your child says &quot;Go away,&quot; do so.</li><li>After the tantrum subsides, your child will often want to be held briefly. This is a good way to get him back into normal family activities.</li></ul></div>\n",

It's a liquid. Use it as follows:</li><li>Use 1 ml (2 ml if over age 1 month). Place in the front of the mouth on each side. Also, put it wherever you see the thrush. It doesn't do any good once it's swallowed. Avoid touching the dropper to the mouth.</li><li>Do this 4 times per day.</li><li>If the thrush isn't getting better, rub the medicine directly on the thrush. Use a cotton swab to do this.</li><li>Don't feed your baby anything for 30 minutes after the medicine.</li><li>Keep this up for at least 7 days. Also, continue it until all thrush has been gone for 3 days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Decrease Sucking Time to 20 Minutes per Feeding:</strong>  <ul><li>Reason: Too much sucking can irritate the lining of the mouth. This makes it more prone to a yeast infection.  A common example of this is when a baby sleeps with a bottle.</li><li>For severe mouth pain with bottle feeding, don't use a bottle. Reason: The nipple can make pain worse.</li><li>Try giving fluids in a cup, spoon or syringe instead.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Limit Pacifier Use:</strong>  <ul><li>Too much sucking on a pacifier can irritate the mouth.</li><li>Limit pacifier use to times when nothing else will calm your baby.</li><li>If your infant is using an orthodontic pacifier, switch to a smaller, regular one. Reason: Bigger ones can cause more friction in the mouth.</li><li>Special washing or boiling of pacifiers or bottle nipples is not needed nor helpful.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Breastfeeding:</strong><ul><li>If the mother's nipples are red and sore, it's probably a yeast infection.</li><li>Use Lotrimin cream on the nipple area.</li><li>No prescription is needed.</li><li>Put it on 4 times per day AFTER feedings.</li><li>Wash off the nipples with warm water before applying the cream. Also, wash the cream off the nipples before each nursing. Avoid soap which dries out the skin.</li><li>If your nipple infection becomes worse, call your OB. You may need an oral anti-yeast medicine.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Diaper Rash:</strong><ul><li>If there's a bad diaper rash, it can also be due to yeast.</li><li>Use Lotrimin cream on the diaper rash.</li><li>No prescription is needed.</li><li>Put it on 4 times per day.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect: </strong><ul><li>With treatment, thrush usually clears up in 4 to 5 days. </li><li>Without treatment, it clears up in 2-8 weeks.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return to Child Care:</strong><ul><li>Thrush cannot be spread to others, since it does not invade normal skin.</li><li>Your child can go to child care with thrush.</li></ul></div>\n",

After feeding, it can triple in size. Sometimes, it can pass on Rocky Mountain spotted fever or Colorado tick fever.</li><li>The deer tick is the size of a poppy seed (pinhead). After feeding, it can triple in size. Sometimes, it can pass on Lyme disease.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Lyme Disease</strong></p><ul><li>The risk of Lyme disease after a deer tick bite is low. Even in a high risk area, the risk is about 2%.</li><li>Most infections (80%) start with a bull's eye rash. The medical name is erythema migrans (EM). The rash starts at the site of the tick bite. EM usually is solid red. Central clearing is present in 30%. EM starts on the average at 7 days. It grows larger quickly to more than 2 inches (5 cm) wide. It lasts 2 or 3 weeks.</li><li>Onset: On the average, Lyme disease starts 7 days after the bite. (Range: 3-30 days).</li><li>Treatment of erythema migrans with an antibiotic is advised. This almost always prevents the development of later stages of Lyme Disease. Arthritis, heart disease and neurologic disease can occur if Lyme Disease is not treated.</li><li>Giving an antibiotic after a deer tick bite to prevent Lyme disease depends on the risk. The risk is low with brief attachment. An antibiotic is not needed.</li><li>The risk is high if the deer tick was attached for longer than 36 hours. It's also high if the tick is swollen, not flat. An antibiotic may be needed. Your doctor will help you decide.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Tick Bites</strong></p><ul><li>When hiking in tick-prone areas, wear long clothing. Tuck the ends of pants into socks.</li><li>Do tick checks at the end of each day. Early removal of ticks within 36 hours can prevent Lyme disease.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Tick Repellent for Clothing - Permethrin</strong></p><ul><li>Permethrin products (such Duranon or Permanone Tick Spray) are very good tick repellents.</li><li>An advantage over DEET is that permethrin is used on clothing. Put it on clothes, especially pants cuffs, socks and shoes. You can also put it on other outdoor items (mosquito screen, sleeping bags).</li><li>Do not put Permethrin on skin. Reason: It loses its ability to work once in contact with skin.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Tick Repellent for Skin - DEET</strong></p><ul><li>DEET is a good tick repellent. It can be used on the skin not covered by clothing.</li><li>Use 30% DEET for children and teens (AAP). Note: 30% DEET protects for 6 hours.</li><li>DEET is approved for use in children over 2 months of age. (AAP)</li></ul>\n",

Lyme disease mainly occurs in the Northeast and upper Midwest. Many states do not have Lyme disease.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Overview - Wood Tick Bites:</strong> <ul><li>Most wood tick bites are harmless.</li><li>The spread of disease by wood ticks is uncommon. </li><li>If the tick is still attached to the skin, it needs to be removed.</li><li>Here is some care advice that should help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Deer Tick - How to Remove:</strong><ul><li>If a deer tick is swollen, try to remove it with a tweezers.</li><li>If it is tiny, it needs to be scraped off.</li><li>Use the edge of a credit card.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Wood Tick Removal: Use a Tweezers</strong> <ul><li>Use a tweezers and grasp the tick close to the skin (on its head).</li><li>Hold the tweezers sideways next to the skin surface.</li><li>Pull the wood tick straight upward without twisting or crushing it.</li><li>Maintain a steady pressure until it releases its grip.</li><li>If you don't have tweezers, you can use your fingers.</li><li><strong>Other options.</strong> You can use a loop of thread around the jaws. You can also use a needle pushed between the jaws for traction.

      "HTML Column 1": "<ul><li>Your child has many behavioral problems and is out of control</li><li>Your child refuses to stay in time-out after using this plan for 1 week</li><li>Your child's misbehavior has not improved after using this plan for 4 weeks</li><li>You have other questions or concerns</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"> </p>\n",
      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>When to Give a Time-Out </strong></p><ul><li>Time-out is most useful for aggressive, harmful, or any disruptive behavior that cannot be ignored. </li><li>Time-out is not needed for most temper tantrums. </li><li>Time-out is the most effective consequence for toddlers and preschoolers who misbehave. It's much better than threatening, shouting, or spanking</li><li>The peak ages for using time-out are 2 to 5 years. During these years, children respond to actions much better than words. Time-out is not ever needed before a child can walk. Time-out is rarely needed for children younger than 18 months because they usually respond to verbal disapproval (a simple &quot;No&quot;).</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><ul><li>If you use time-out repeatedly, consistently, and correctly, your child will eventually improve. It can change almost any childhood behavior. </li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Teach Your Child What a Time-Out Is: </strong><ul><li>If you have not used time-out before, go over it with your child.</li><li>Review the kinds of bad behavior that require a time-out. Also, review the good behavior that you would prefer.</li><li>Tell your child it will replace yelling and spanking, if you have used those techniques.</li><li>Then do a practice run. Pretend with your child that he has broken one of the rules. Take him through the steps of time-out so he will understand what to do when he needs a time-out in the future. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Younger Child Who Refuses to Stay in Time-Out:</strong><ul><li>In general, if a child escapes from time-out (gets up from the chair), you should quickly take the child back to time-out and reset the timer. This approach works for most children.</li><li>Some strong-willed toddlers initially need to be held in time-out. Holding your child in time-out teaches your child that you mean what you say and that he must comply. Place your child in the time-out chair again and hold him by the shoulders from behind. Tell your child that you will stop holding him when he stops trying to escape.</li><li>Then avoid eye contact and any talking. Pretend that you don't mind doing this and are thinking of something else.</li><li>When the time is up, tell your child &quot;that was a good time-out&quot; whether it was or not. Your child will usually stop trying to escape after a week of this holding approach.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Give Up on Using Time-Outs:</strong><ul><li>Some children repeat their misbehavior immediately after release from time-out. Others seem to improve but by the next day are back at it. Some children refuse to go to time-out or won't stay there. None of these examples means that time-out should be abandoned. </li><li>It remains the most powerful discipline technique for 2- to 5-year-old children. </li><li>The following recommendations may help you fine-tune how you are using time-out.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Time-Out Chair: </strong><ul><li>Pick a chair for time-outs. The chair should be in a boring location, facing a blank wall or a corner. </li><li>Don't allow your child to take anything with him to time-out, such as a stuffed animal or security blanket. Your child shouldn't be able to see TV or other people from the location. </li><li>A good chair is a heavy one with side arms. The special chair can also be named after the misbehavior you are trying to stop: such as your hitting chair or screaming chair.</li><li>Alternatives to chairs are standing in a particular corner or sitting on the lower step of a stairway. </li><li>If you are in the same room as your child, carefully avoid making eye contact. </li></ul> </div><div><strong>Younger Child Who Won't Sit in the Time-Out Chair:</strong><ul><li>A last resort for young children who continue to resist sitting in a chair is putting them in the bedroom with a strong gate blocking the door.</li><li>Occasionally, a parent with carpentry skills can install a half-door.</li><li>If you cannot devise a barricade, some children will need you to close the door. When you do say, &quot;I'm sorry I have to close the door. I'll open it when you promise to stay in your room for your time-out.&quot; Hold the door closed for the 3 to 5 minutes it takes to complete the time-out period. Most children need their door closed only a few times.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give Your Child More Physical Affection Each Day: </strong><ul><li>Be sure your child receives several time-ins for each time-out. A time-in is a brief caring human interaction. </li><li>Try to restore the positive side of your relationship with your child. Catch him being good. Give your child a hug many times a day. For younger children, hold them closely for a few minutes many times a day. Play with your child more. </li><li>Children who are overly criticized can feel that they are no longer loved. Then they no longer want to please you.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Time-Out Room: </strong><ul><li>Children who refuse to stay in a time-out chair need to be sent to a time-out room. Keeping a child in a room is easier to enforce. </li><li>The room should be one that is safe for the child. The child's bedroom is often the most convenient one. Although toys are available in the bedroom, most children do not initially play with them because they are upset about being excluded from mainstream activities. </li><li>Caution: Avoid any room that is dark or scary (such as some basements), contains hot water (bathrooms), or has filing cabinets or bookshelves that could be pulled down on the child.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Older Child Who Refuses to Stay in Time-Out:</strong><ul><li>An older child can be defined in this context as one who is too strong for the parent to hold in a time-out chair. In general, any child older than 5 years who does not take time-out quickly should be considered a &quot;refuser&quot;.</li><li>Time-out always needs a backup plan.</li><li>Change the consequence to one that matters to your child. If 5 minutes pass without your child going to time-out, take away a privilege or possession. Tell your child that they just lost TV, video games, a favorite toy, outside play or visits with friends until they take their time-out. That can mean for the rest of that day. After giving the consequence, walk away and no longer discuss it.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Use Time-Out Only For The One Worse Behavior You Are Trying to Change:</strong><ul><li>Pick your one main &quot;problem behavior&quot; and concentrate on that. Use your time-out consequence only for that target behavior.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Send Your Child to Time-Out: </strong><ul><li>You ask your child to stop doing something, and they do not. You tell them again, and they do not comply. </li><li>Stop talking and state &quot;you need a time-out&quot;. If your child doesn't go to time-out within 5 seconds, take him there. Younger children often need to be led there by their hand. In some cases, they may need to be carried there protesting. Older children will usually go to time-out on their own. </li><li>Take him to time-out without talking. Or you can tell your child what he did wrong in one sentence (such as, &quot;No hitting&quot;). Sometimes also clarify the preferred behavior (such as, &quot;Be kind to Zoe&quot;). These brief comments give your child something to think about during the time-out. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Time-Out Away from Home:</strong><ul><li>Time-out can be effectively used in any setting. </li><li>In a supermarket, younger children can be put back in the grocery cart. Older children may need to stand in a corner. </li><li>In shopping malls, children can take their time-out sitting on a bench or in a restroom. </li><li>Sometimes a child needs to be taken to the car and made to sit there with supervision. </li><li>If the child is outdoors and misbehaves, you can ask him to stand facing a tree.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Threaten to Give a Time-Out, Just Do It: </strong><ul><li>See the popular book &quot;1-2-3 Magic&quot; by psychologist Thomas Phelan PhD. He uses a slow 3-count prior to requiring the time-out. This 3-warning approach helps many children accept the requested change and avoid the time-out. </li><li>The main point is don't give repeated warnings. If you tell your child to stop doing something and they don't, give them a time-out. No discussion. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Decide the Length of Time-Out: </strong><ul><li>Time-out should be brief so your child can easily comply. A good rule of thumb is 1 minute per year of age (with an upper limit of 5 minutes). After age 6, most children can be told they must take a time-out &quot;until you can behave&quot; or &quot;until you calm down.&quot; This allows the child to recover quickly if they are able. </li><li>Setting a portable kitchen timer for the required number of minutes can be helpful. The best type rings when the time is up. A timer can stop a child from asking the parents when he can come out.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Put Your Child in Time-Out Quickly:</strong> <ul><li>Don't argue about it with your child. </li><li>When your child breaks a rule, have her in time-out within 10 seconds.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Quiet Behavior in Time-Out: Required or Not? </strong><ul><li>The minimum requirement for time-out completion is that your child does not leave the chair or time-out place until the time-out is over. If your child leaves ahead of time, return them and reset the timer.</li><li>Some parents do not consider a time-out to be completed unless the child has been quiet for the entire time. Until 4 years of age, many children are unwilling or unable to stay quiet. Ignore tantrums in time-out, just as you would ignore tantrums outside of time-out. After age 4, quiet time is preferred but not required. If you wish, you can tell your child, &quot;Time-out is for thinking, and to think need to be quiet. If you yell or complain, the time will start over.&quot;</li></ul></div><div><strong>Be Gentle When Moving Your Child to Time-Out:</strong> <ul><li>This will help reduce your child's anger. </li><li>Say you're sorry he needs a time-out, but be firm about it.</li><li>Try to handle your child gently if you have to carry him to time-out.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Release Your Child from Time-Out:</strong> <ul><li>To be released, your child must have performed a successful time-out. This means he stayed in time-out for the required number of minutes.</li><li>Your child can leave time-out when the timer rings. If you don't have a timer, he can leave when you tell him, &quot;Time-out is over. You can get up now.&quot;</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give Your Child a Choice About How He Takes His Time-Out: </strong><ul><li>Ask, &quot;Do you want to take a time-out by yourself or do you want me to hold you in your chair? It doesn't matter to me.&quot; Also known as the easy way or the hard way.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Talk to Your Child During Time-Out:</strong> <ul><li>Don't answer his questions or complaints. Don't try to lecture your child.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ignore Tantrums in Time-Out: </strong><ul><li>Don't insist on quietness during time-out. Reason: Makes it harder to finish the time-out and move on.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Return Your Child to Time-Out if He Escapes:</strong> <ul><li>Have a back-up plan. </li><li>For example, you can hold a young child in the time-out chair, or ground an older child. </li><li>See detailed discussion under Special Time-Out Problems.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Use a Portable Timer for Keeping Track of the Time:</strong> <ul><li>Your child is more likely to obey a timer than to obey you.</li><li>A timer can be very helpful for toddlers.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Allow Your Child to Come out of Time-Out as soon as Feels Calmer:</strong><ul><li>Give your child the option to regain self-control on their terms rather than taking the specified number of minutes. This helps strong-willed children.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Praise Your Child for Taking a &quot;Good&quot; Time-Out: </strong><ul><li>Forgive your child completely when you release him from time-out. </li><li>Don't give lectures or ask for an apology. </li><li>Give your child a clean slate and don't tell your partner how many time-outs he needed that day.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Use Different Consequences for Different Misbehaviors:</strong><ul><li>Ignore harmless behaviors.</li><li>Use distraction for bad habits.</li><li>Use logical consequences -- such as removal of toys, other possessions, or privileges -- for some misbehavior.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Clarify With Your Child What You Want Him To Do: </strong><ul><li>Clarify the important house rules. </li><li>Memory requires repetition. Review rules at a time when your child is in a good mood. </li><li>This will help him be more successful in the future.</li></ul></div>\n",

Most often, this is from kicking a ball while barefoot. The energy is absorbed by the joint surface and the injury occurs there.</li><li><strong>Crushed or Smashed Toe.</strong> Most often, this is from a heavy object on falling the toe. The end of the toe may get a few cuts. Sometimes, the nail can be damaged. Broken bones are not common with this kind of injury.</li><li><strong>Toenail Injury.</strong> If the nailbed is cut, it may need sutures to prevent a deformed nail. This is more important for fingernails.</li><li><strong>Blood Clot under the Nail.</strong> Most often caused by a crush injury. This can be from a heavy object falling on the toe. Many are only mildly painful. Some are severely painful and throbbing. These need the pressure under the nail released. This can relieve the pain and prevent loss of the toenail.</li><li><strong>Fractures or Dislocations.</strong> Most swollen, bruised and painful toes are not broken.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Symptoms</strong></p><ul><li>The main symptom is pain.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention</strong></p><ul><li>Careful adult supervision of young children</li><li>Education of older children about high risk behaviors</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"> </p>\n",

Press for 10 minutes.</li><li>Wash the wound with soap and water for 5 minutes.</li><li>For any dirt in the wound, scrub gently.</li><li>For any cuts, use an antibiotic ointment such as Polysporin. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Cover it with a Band-Aid. Change daily.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Jammed Toe:</strong><ul><li>Soak the foot in cold water for 20 minutes.</li><li>To help with the pain, give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed.</li><li>If the pain is more than mild, &quot;buddy-tape&quot; it to the next toe. Place a cotton ball between the toes before taping them together. Do this for a few days.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Smashed or Crushed Toe:</strong><ul><li>Wash the toe with soap and water for 5 minutes.</li><li>Trim any small pieces of torn skin with a fine scissors. Clean them first with rubbing alcohol.</li><li>For any cuts, use an antibiotic ointment such as Polysporin. No prescription is needed.</li><li>Cover it with a Band-Aid. Change daily.</li><li>To help with the pain, give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Torn Nail (from catching it on something):</strong><ul><li>For a cracked nail without rough edges, leave it alone.</li><li>For a large flap of nail that's almost torn through, cut it off. Use a pair of scissors that have been cleaned. Cut along the line of the tear. Reason: Pieces of nail taped in place will catch on objects.</li><li>Soak the foot for 20 minutes in cold water for pain relief.</li><li>Use an antibiotic ointment such as Polysporin. No prescription is needed. Then cover with a Band-Aid. Change daily.</li><li>After about 7 days, the nailbed should be covered by new skin. It should no longer hurt. A new nail will grow in over 6 to 8 weeks.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Pain Medicine:</strong> <ul><li>To help with the pain, give acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Use as needed.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Shoes to Reduce Pain:</strong> <ul><li>If regular shoes cause too much pain, change footwear.</li><li>Wear a shoe with a firm sole to limit motion. Reason: Injured toes hurt when they bend. </li><li>If the top of the shoe increases pain, wear an open-toe sandal. Another option is to use an old sneaker. Then cut out the part over the toe.</li></ul></div>\n",

Use your fingernail to lift it.</li><li>Dry the toe and foot completely.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Elevate Corner of Toenail with Dental Floss:</strong> <ul><li>Goal: To help the toenail corner grow over the cuticle, rather than into it.</li><li>The area won't heal until you expose the corner.</li><li>Often you can lift it with your fingernail.</li><li>If not, take  a short strip of dental floss or fishing line.

Cut off any sharp edge.</li><li>Elevate the corner away from the cuticle with every soak.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Antibiotic Ointment:  </strong><ul><li>After each soak, put an antibiotic ointment on the swollen part of the toe.</li><li>You can buy this ointment without a prescription.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Taking Pressure Off Toenail With a Foam Pad or Cotton Ball:</strong> <ul><li>Until it heals, try to wear sandals or go barefoot.</li><li>When your child must wear closed shoes protect the ingrown toenail as follows:</li><li>If the INNER edge of the big toe is involved, try this technique. Tape a foam pad or cotton ball between the lower part of the first and second toes. Your goal is to keep the upper toes from touching.</li><li>If the OUTER edge is involved, do the same to the outside of the lower toe. Goal: keep the toenail from touching the side of the shoe.</li><li>Weather-stripping from a hardware store makes the best foam pad. Reason: has adhesive on one side.</li><li>Never wear tight, narrow, or pointed shoes.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Prevention - Nail Trimming:</strong> <ul><li>Cut your child's toenails straight across so you can see the corners. Use a nail clipper.</li><li>Do not round off corners (keep the corners visible).</li><li>Do not cut them too short.</li><li>After baths or showers, the nails are soft. Bend the corners of the toenails upward. Use your fingernail to lift it.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Prevention - Wear Shoes That Fit: </strong><ul><li>Make sure that your child's shoes are not too narrow. Give away any pointed or tight shoes. </li><li>Tight narrow shoes are the most common cause of ingrown toenails. </li><li>Shoes should have a wide toe box. The toes should not feel cramped.</li></ul></div><div><strong>What to Expect:</strong><ul><li>With treatment, the pus should be gone in 48 hours.</li><li>Pain should be gone in 1 week.</li><li>Area should be healed up in 2 weeks.</li></ul></div>\n",

Both kinds of control can be worked on at the same time.</li><li>Bedwetting is different. Bladder control through the night normally happens several years later than daytime control.</li><li>Most toilet training can be completed in 1 to 2 months. However, your child needs to be ready before you start.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Toilet ReadinessTraining </strong></p><ul><li>Don't begin training until your child is clearly ready. Readiness doesn't just happen.</li><li>Toilet readiness training involves concepts and skills you teach your child. This can start at 18 months of age or earlier.</li><li>All children can be made ready for toilet training by 3 years. Most are ready by 2 1/2 years. Some can be ready by 2 years and occasionally even younger. Ways to help children become ready are found in the handout, &quot;Toilet Readiness Training&quot;.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>How to Know if Your Child is Ready to Start Real Toilet Training</strong></p><ul><li>Your child can recognize the sensation of a full bladder and full rectum</li><li>Your child knows what the potty is for</li><li>Your child likes to sit on his potty chair</li><li>Your child is cooperative with verbal requests</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Encourage Practice Runs to the Potty:</strong><ul><li>A practice run (potty sit) is encouraging your child to walk to the potty. Then, have your child sit on it with his diapers or pants off. Your child can then be told, &quot;Try to go pee-pee in the potty&quot;.</li><li>Only do practice runs when your child gives a signal that looks promising. Such signals are a certain facial expression, grunting or holding the genital area. He may also pull at his pants. You may notice pacing, squatting, or grimacing.</li><li>Other good times for practice runs are after naps or 2 hours without passin urine. You can also try about 20 minutes after meals or a big drink. Say, &quot;The poop or pee wants to come out. Let's use the potty&quot;.</li><li>If your child doesn't want to sit on the potty, read him a story there.</li><li>If your child wants to get up after 1 minute of encouragement, let him get up. Never force your child to sit there. Never physically hold your child there. Even if your child seems to be enjoying it, end each session after 5 minutes.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Keep a Potty Chair Close By:</strong><ul><li>Initially, keep the potty chair in the room your child usually plays in.</li><li>This easy access increases the chances that he'll use it without you asking.</li><li>Consider owning 2 potty chairs.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Wear Clothing That is Easy to Remove:</strong><ul><li>During toilet training, children need to wear one layer of clothing. That usually means training pants or regular underwear.</li><li>Avoid shoes and pants.</li><li>In the wintertime, turn up the heat or wear loose sweatpants.</li><li>Avoid any pants with zippers, buttons, snaps, or a belt.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Praise Your Child for Cooperation and Reward any Success:</strong><ul><li>All cooperation with these practice sessions should be praised.</li><li>For example, you might say, &quot;You are sitting on the potty just like Mommy.&quot; Or, &quot;You're trying real hard to go pee-pee in the potty&quot;.</li><li>If your child urinates into the potty, he can be rewarded with treats. For example, you can use animal cookies or stickers. Also, give lots of praise and hugs .</li><li>A sense of accomplishment is enough for some children. However, many need treats to stay focused.</li><li>Big rewards like going to the toy store should be reserved for big steps. For instance, when your child walks over to the potty on his own and uses it. Or asks to go there with you and then uses it.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Practice Runs - When to Stop:</strong><ul><li>Once your child uses the potty by himself 2 or more times, you can stop the practice runs.</li><li>For the following week, continue to praise your child frequently for using the potty.</li><li>Practice runs and reminders should not be necessary for more than 1 or 2 months.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Change Your Child Calmly After Accidents:</strong> <ul><li>Change your child as soon as it's convenient. Respond with kindness. Say, &quot;You wanted to go pee in the potty, but you went in your pants. I know that makes you sad. You like to be dry. You'll get better at this.&quot;</li><li>If you feel a need to be critical, keep it to mild verbal disapproval. Use it rarely. For example, &quot;Big boys don't go poop in their pants.&quot; Or mention the name of another child whom he likes and who is trained.</li><li>Change your child into a dry diaper or training pants in a pleasant manner.</li><li>Don't show anger. Avoid physical punishment, yelling, or scolding.</li><li>Pressure or force will start a power struggle. Your child may become completely uncooperative.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Regular Underwear - When to Start:</strong><ul><li>Introduce regular underwear after your child starts using the potty.</li><li>Regular underwear can spark motivation.</li><li>Switch training pants to regular underwear after your child passes urine into the potty a few times.</li><li>Buy loose-fitting underwear that he can easily lower and pull up by himself.</li><li>Once in underwear, use diapers only for sleep and travel outside the home.</li></ul></div>\n",

It's your child's poop.</li><li>Explain that &quot;poop&quot; wants to come out. Your child's job is to help the &quot;poop&quot; come out.</li><li>Tell your child from now on they don't need any help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Bowel Cleanout:</strong><ul><li>If your child is blocked up (impacted) with stool, contact your doctor. </li><li>Your doctor may order a bowel cleanout. </li><li>After the cleanout, all children with stool-holding need to be on maintenance medicines. </li><li>They need to be on these medicines until they give up stool-holding.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop All Talk About This Subject:</strong><ul><li>When your child is around, stop talking about toilet training.</li><li>Pretend you're no longer worried about this subject.</li><li>When your child stops receiving attention about not going, they'll eventually decide to go.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give Stool Softeners for Hard Stools:</strong><ul><li>Stool softeners make the stools softer and easier to pass.</li><li>Unlike laxatives, they do not cause any bowel contractions or pressure.</li><li>Common nonprescription stool softeners are Miralax, mineral oil or milk of magnesia.</li><li>Increase the dose gradually until your child is passing 1 or 2 soft stools each day.</li><li>Sometimes, a high fiber diet alone will keep the stools soft.  </li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop Most Reminders About Using the Toilet:</strong><ul><li>Let your child decide when they need to use the toilet.</li><li>They know what it feels like when they have to &quot;poop&quot;. </li><li>Reminders are a form of pressure, and pressure keeps the power struggle going.</li><li>Stop all practice runs.</li><li>Never make your child sit on the toilet because this always greatly increases resistance.</li><li>Your child needs to gain the feeling of success that comes from doing it their way.</li><li>There are a few exceptions to reminders discussed in #4 and #5.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give Laxatives to keep the Rectum Empty:</strong><ul><li>Most stool holders also need a laxative to keep them empty.</li><li>Laxatives (bowel stimulants) cause the large intestine to contract. This pushes the stool toward the rectum. It's usually given if you child goes 2 days without a normal size poop. </li><li>Most laxatives contain senna, a natural plant extract.</li><li>Don't worry that your child might become dependent on laxatives. This means the bowels won't move well without them. Laxative dependency doesn't happen in children. </li><li>Children can be gradually withdrawn from laxatives, even after many months of using them.</li><li>The most important goal is keeping the rectum empty. This is the goal until your child gives up stool holding.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Remind to use the Toilet if Your Child has Abdominal Pain:</strong><ul><li>Holding back stool hurts the body. So, there are some exceptions to reminding.</li><li>If your child says their stomach hurts, explain how to make it go away.</li><li>Tell them: &quot;The poop wants to come out. Holding back makes your tummy hurt&quot;.</li><li>If your child refuses, tell them, &quot;I can't help you. You have to help yourself.&quot;</li><li>Then ignore your child. </li><li>Tell them to come back after the poop is out. Do not give positive attention for holding-back behavior.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Remind if Deliberately Holding Back Stool:</strong> <ul><li>If you see your child holding back a stool, initially say nothing. This approach is in hopes your child will do the right thing.</li><li>If your child holds back for more than 5 minutes, give a pleasant reminder.</li><li>First say, &quot;Your body is talking to you. What does it want you to do?&quot; If necessary, add &quot;The poop wants to come out and go in the toilet. The poop needs your help.&quot;</li><li>Tell your child that you want sitting on the potty to be fun. What would they like to do?</li><li>If your child declines the offer to provide a special potty activity, say nothing more.</li><li>Let your child decide how they wish to respond to the pressure in their bottom.</li></ul></div><div><strong>For Stool Leakage, Ground your Child until Passes a Stool (4 and older):</strong><ul><li>If your child is over 4 and leaking stool, ground him until he passes a stool.</li><li>State &quot;When poop leaks out, it always means there's a big poop inside. It's trying to get out. You need time to think about how to help your body get it out.&quot;</li><li>Tell your child he's grounded until he passes a big poop.</li><li>He can only go to essential events. Examples are meals, preschool or school, church. Also, he can go to scheduled classes such as music lessons or team events. Otherwise, he's grounded in his bedroom. This means no TV, games, friends over or playing outside. This goes on until he completes his assignment.</li><li>Using the term &quot;poop jail&quot; usually makes this funny and more acceptable for kids.</li></ul></div><div><strong>If Grounding is Necessary, Protect Your Role as the Child's Ally:</strong><ul><li>You can tell your child that this is what the doctor said to do.</li><li>If your child complains, give him a hug.</li><li>If this approach doesn't work, consider restricting your child to the bathroom.</li><li>Inform him he can't come out until he produces a big poop.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ground Your Child for No Stool in 3 Days:</strong><ul><li>If your child reaches day 3 without passing stool, ground your child.</li><li>Grounding should be in place until he passes a big poop.</li><li>&quot;Big&quot; means at least the size of a banana.</li><li>Remember that holding it back causes it to become larger and wider. After 5 to 7 days, it will become too wide to pass. The medical term for this is stool impaction.</li><li>For children younger than 4, put them in a pull-up at these times. Encourage them to let go of their poop.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give Incentives for Releasing Stools:</strong><ul><li>Our main goal is to help your child give up stool-holding.</li><li>Your main job is to find the right incentive.</li><li>Special rewards, such as favorite sweets or video time, can be invaluable. For using the toilet for stools, initially use big rewards. For example, special games or going somewhere special can be used.</li><li>Remember that an incentive works even better if it is special. That means a treat that your child doesn't otherwise get.</li><li>If you want a breakthrough, make your child an offer they can't refuse.</li><li>For children under 4, give incentives for pooping into diapers (pull-ups) if they won't use the toilet. </li><li>For details, see the handout: Incentives for Motivating Your Child.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Keep Sticker Chart for Using the Toilet:</strong> <ul><li>Get a calendar for your child. Post it in a very obvious area. Call it the Good Pooper chart.</li><li>Have them place a star on it every time they poop in the toilet. You can also use stickers that your child picks out.</li><li>Keep this record of progress until your child has gone 1 month without any soiling.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Allow Diapers or Pull-ups for Poops if Needed:</strong><ul><li>We want your child to look forward to releasing stools, rather than holding back.</li><li>If your child refuses to sit on the toilet, having stools in diapers is better than stool holding. Therefore, permit access to diapers.</li><li>Another option is to keep pull-ups next to the potty chair or toilet.</li><li>Keep your child in loose-fitting underwear during the day.</li><li>Wearing underwear also gives your child an incentive to maintain bladder control (urine).</li></ul></div><div><strong>Help Your Child Change Clothes for Soiling:</strong> <ul><li>Don't ignore soiling.</li><li>Your main role is to enforce the rule &quot;people can't walk around with messy pants.&quot;</li><li>Your child will need your help with poop cleanup until at least age 6.</li><li>Make changing a neutral, quick interaction. Always dump the stool in the toilet. Have your child watch you do it.</li><li>If your child refuses to let you change them, ground your child. Put them in time-out until they are ready.</li><li>Caution: Never wait for over 30 minutes to change a poopy diaper. Reason: Stools can cause skin irritation. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Keep Your Child's Follow-up Appointments:</strong><ul><li>All children with stool-holding need regular visits with their primary care doctor.</li><li>All children with stool-holding need to be on medicines for a long time. Their doctor needs to help you monitor the dosage of the medicines.</li><li>This is the only way to prevent getting blocked up.</li></ul></div>\n",

      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Causes</strong> </p><ul><li>The most common cause of chronic soiling is resistance to using the toilet. This is called bowel training resistance. Many of these children refuse to even sit on the toilet. They may sit on the toilet only if the parent requires it. But, they don't release the stool until after they get off.</li><li>Bowel training is usually accomplished in 2 to 3 months. Healthy children over 3 who aren't using the toilet after 3 months have toilet training resistance. About 5% of children refuse to be bowel trained.</li><li>The most common cause of toilet training resistance is a strong-willed child. In addition, they have been reminded or lectured too much. Most children have been forced to sit on the toilet against their will.  A few have been punished for not cooperating. Many parents make these mistakes. This can be common if you have a child with a difficult temperament. </li><li>Most children under 6 with encopresis are simply engaged in a power struggle with you. More practice, such as you used in toilet training, will not help. Instead, your child now needs to take full responsibility. He will need some incentives to spark his interest.</li><li>Sometimes, encopresis begins all of a sudden in a toilet trained child. When this happens, the cause is usually a new stress. The stress may be a physical illness such as severe diarrhea. It can also be an emotional upset such as going to a new school. These children usually regain bowel control when the stress is reduced or gone.</li><li>If your child starts holding back stools and becomes constipated, medicines will be needed.</li></ul>\n",

Also, apologize for any past punishment or forced sitting on the toilet.</li><li>Tell your child from now on they don't need any help.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop All Reminders About Using the Toilet:</strong><ul><li>Let your child decide when they need to use the toilet. Don't remind him to use the bathroom or ask if he needs to go.</li><li>They know what it feels like when they have to &quot;poop&quot;.</li><li>Reminders are a form of pressure, and pressure keeps the power struggle going.</li><li>Stop all practice runs.</li><li>Never make your child sit on the toilet because this always greatly increases resistance.</li><li>Don't go with your child into the bathroom unless he asks you to.</li><li>Your child needs to feel success when he does it his way.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop All Talk About This Subject:</strong><ul><li>When your child is around, stop talking about toilet training.</li><li>Pretend you're not worried about this subject.</li><li>When your child stops receiving attention about not going, they'll eventually decide to go.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Give Incentives for Using the Toilet:</strong><ul><li>Your main job is to find the right incentive. Incentives should replace reminders.</li><li>Special rewards, such as favorite sweets or video time, can be invaluable. For using the toilet for stools, initially use big rewards. For example, special games or going somewhere special can be used.</li><li>Remember that an incentive works even better if it is special. That means a treat that your child doesn't otherwise get.</li><li>If you want a breakthrough, make your child an offer they can't refuse.</li><li>For details, see the handout: Incentives for Motivating Your Child.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Keep a Sticker Chart for Using the Toilet:</strong> <ul><li>Get a calendar for your child. Post it in a very obvious area. Call it the Good Pooper chart.</li><li>Have them place a star on it every time they poop in the toilet. You can also use stickers that your child picks out.</li><li>Keep this record of progress until your child has gone 1 month without any accidents.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Not Sitting on the Toilet - How to Help:</strong> <ul><li>Keep the potty chair in the room he usually plays in.</li><li>If he is clearly trying not to go, remind him in a kind way. Say: &quot;The poop wants to come out and go in the toilet. The poop needs your help.&quot; Try to make it funny.</li><li>Then, let your child decide how to respond to the pressure in their bottom.</li><li>You may even need to say: &quot; You don't know how to sit on the toilet&quot;. Your child will want to prove you wrong.</li><li>Some children may need smaller treats for simply sitting on the toilet.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Use Diapers or Pull-ups As Little as Possible:</strong><ul><li>Keep your child in loose-fitting underwear (or training pants) during the day. Wearing underwear also gives your child an incentive to maintain bladder control (urine).</li><li>If your child starts stool-holding, put him back in diapers. </li><li>Another option is to keep pull-ups next to the potty chair or toilet.</li><li>Your child can decide whether to use the toilet or put on a pull-up..</li></ul></div><div><strong>Help Your Child Change Clothes for Soiling:</strong> <ul><li>Don't ignore soiling.</li><li>Your main role is to enforce the rule &quot;people can't walk around with messy pants.&quot;</li><li>Your child will need your help with cleanup until at least age 6.</li><li>Make changing a neutral, quick interaction. Always dump the stool in the toilet with your child's help.</li><li>If your child refuses to let you change them, ground your child. Put them in time-out until they are ready.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Ask the Preschool/Child Care Staff to use the Same Strategy as Yours: </strong><ul><li>Talk to your child's teacher or child care provider. </li><li>Ask that your child use the bathroom any time they want to. </li><li>Keep extra clean underwear at school or with the child care provider. </li><li>Ask them to read this handout. </li><li>Be sure your baby sitter knows how to handle the situation positively. </li><li>Do not punish for soiling pants. </li></ul></div>\n",

But be sure to read information written by experts on vaccines and the infections they prevent.</li><li>Celebrities are not experts. Some opponents to vaccines don't even believe in medical research. Some have made extreme claims that are completely false. </li><li>Facts are different than opinions. Facts are backed by science. Facts don't have 2 sides. We hope you will take the following facts into consideration.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Vaccine Benefits Have Changed the World:</strong><ul><li>Vaccines are the most powerful tool we have to prevent serious infections.</li><li>Vaccines wiped out smallpox in the world. Polio is almost gone.</li><li>Bacterial meningitis was widespread. It caused terrible brain damage or death. There are now 3 meningitis vaccines and the disease has become uncommon.</li><li>With increasing antibiotic resistance, vaccines against bacteria are becoming even more important.</li><li>Finally, the HPV vaccine prevents cancer of the cervix and throat. That's right, prevents cancer!</li></ul></div><div><strong>Every Science-Based Organization Recommends Vaccines:</strong><ul><li>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) encourages universal vaccination of all children. So does the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</li><li>Over 99% of doctors and nurses protect their own children with vaccines.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Autism Concerns Are False:</strong><ul><li>The autism-vaccine connection has been completely disproven. </li><li>The doctor who started this false claim lost his medical license.</li><li>Extensive research has shown that vaccines are safe and do not cause autism. </li><li>Autism is mostly caused by changes in the genes before birth. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Giving Multiple Vaccines at the Same Time is Best:</strong><ul><li>Research has proven that your baby's immune system can respond to multiple vaccines. It is safe and does not cause worse reactions.</li><li>Also, your baby does not experience greater pain from multiple shots. Shots are given quickly and your child's brain can't tell whether it got 1 or 3 shots.</li><li>Spreading shots out over several visits can be done, but there are no benefits. It also means more doctor visits for you. It means more shot pain for your baby. And it means leaving your baby unprotected against some diseases.</li><li>Combination vaccines are already available (such as MMR or DTaP). They reduce the number of shots a child needs.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Vaccines Don't Cause Infections:</strong><ul><li>Vaccines cannot cause the infections they are used to prevent.</li><li>In fact, most vaccines contain dead bacteria or viruses.</li><li>A sore injection site for a few days is usually the only side effect.</li><li>Occasionally, a mild fever may also occur after certain shots. This just means the vaccine is working. It is harmless and doesn't mean your child is sick.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Outbreaks of These Diseases Still Occur: </strong><ul><li>The diseases covered by vaccines are bad infections. Most are still around in our country. Travel increases the risk of getting them.</li><li>Recent outbreaks of whooping cough and measles have occurred in the U.S.</li><li>The infections mainly occurred in unvaccinated children.</li><li>Many of the children needed to be admitted to the hospital.</li><li>These outbreaks could have been prevented.</li><li>During outbreaks, unvaccinated children often need to be excluded from school. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Final Thought on Vaccines:</strong><ul><li>Getting your child vaccinated could save his or her life.</li><li>At a minimum, never delay the vaccines that can prevent meningitis.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Internet Resource: CDC Website</strong><ul><li>The best website for trusted information about vaccines: <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/conversations \">www.cdc.gov/vaccines/conversations </a></li></ul> </div>\n",

Swelling up to 3 inches (7.5 cm) can normally occur with 5th (4 years) dose. This is not an allergic reaction. Future DTaP vaccines are safe to give.</li><li>Any hives and itching around the shot site is normal. It does not mean your child is allergic to the vaccine.</li><li>Fever with most vaccines begins within 24 hours and lasts 1 to 2 days.</li><li>With the MMR and chickenpox shots, fever and rash occurs in 10% of children.

They start within 2 hours.</li><li><strong>Abnormal reaction:</strong> A secondary bacterial infection at the shot site. This is very rare (less than 1 per 1000).

If it lasts over 24 hours, you must think about more serious causes.

(Reason: Water is easily absorbed).</li><li>Other clear fluids: Use half-strength Gatorade. Make it by mixing equal amounts of Gatorade and water. Can mix apple juice the same way. ORS (such as Pedialyte) is usually not needed in older children. Popsicles work great for some kids.</li><li>The key to success is giving small amounts of fluid. Offer 2-3 teaspoons (10-15 ml) every 5 minutes.

An example is Staph toxin in egg salad.</li><li><strong>Coughing.</strong> Hard coughing can also cause your child to throw up.</li><li><strong>Serious Causes.</strong> Vomiting alone (without diarrhea) should stop within about 24 hours.

This is needed regardless of the age at which weaning occurs.</li><li>The longer they don't use a cup, the less willing they'll be to try it.</li><li>Ideally, daily cup feedings are started by 6 months of age. This is a natural way to keep bottle feedings from becoming overly important.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Gradually Stop Bottle Feedings During the Day:</strong> <ul><li>Weaning to the cup should always be done slowly and with love. The &quot;cold turkey&quot; or abrupt withdrawal approach will make your child very upset.</li><li>Get rid of one bottle feeding every 3 to 4 days. Use your child's reaction to figure out how fast this should be done. Replace each bottle feeding with a cup feeding and extra holding.</li><li>Stop bottle feedings in the following order: midday, late afternoon, morning, and finally bedtime.</li><li>For most children, the bedtime feeding is usually the most important one. In giving up this feeding, slowly decrease the amount of milk in the bottle. Do this each day for a week.</li><li>After 2 years, it may be easier to pick a day and stop all bottles abruptly.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Allow Carrying Around a Bottle During the Day:</strong><ul><li>Stop this immediately.</li><li>The companion bottle encourages habit drinking (comfort drinking).</li><li>It can cause serious tooth decay that needs surgery. Called baby bottle tooth decay.</li><li>You can say, &quot;It's not good for you to carry a bottle around&quot;. Say, &quot;You're too old for that.&quot; Another option: &quot;Your doctor said it was bad for your teeth&quot;.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Replace Bottle Feedings with Holding your Child:</strong><ul><li>Do not offer a bottle after you have completed the weaning process.</li><li>Respond to ongoing requests for a bottle by holding your child.</li><li>You can explain that bottles are for little babies. You might have your child help you carry the bottles to a neighbor's house.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop Using Bottle Feeding to Fall Asleep or Allowing a Bottle in the Crib for Sleep:</strong><ul><li>Stop this immediately.</li><li>All babies can handle a 7 to 8 hour fast by 6 months of age. That means they can easily sleep through the night.</li><li>But if they are fed until asleep, they will not learn to self-soothe to sleep. After normal night wakings, they will want a bottle to get back to sleep.</li><li>Also, don't allow your child to take a bottle to bed. This will cause sleep problems as above. Also, taking a bottle of milk to bed may cause severe tooth decay.</li><li>Offer the explanations suggested above in # 4.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Stop Any Night Time Feedings:</strong><ul><li>Ideally, this is done before 6 months.</li><li>If your baby is still waking at night for feeds and over 1 year, ask for help or information in stopping night time feedings.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Start Complete Weaning Now or Later:</strong><ul><li>Once you have made these healthy changes, complete weaning will be much easier. </li><li>Facts to consider: After 12 months of age, the bottle becomes more important to your child. It becomes more of a bad habit with each passing month. Weaning will become harder.</li><li>Caution: Do not start weaning if your family is under stress (such as moving). Also wait if your child is under stress. An example of this is entering a new child care.</li></ul></div>\n",

After normal night wakings, they will want the breast to get back to sleep.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Replace Nursing with Holding Your Child:</strong><ul><li>Do not offer the breast after you have completed the weaning process.</li><li>Wear a top that completely hides your breasts.</li><li>Respond to ongoing requests to nurse by holding your child and comforting her.</li><li>Explain to your child that the milk is all gone from your breasts.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Phase Out Any Night Time Breast Feedings:</strong><ul><li>Ideally, this is done before 6 months.</li><li>If your child is still feeding at night after 1 year, ask for help or information on how to gradually phase out night time feedings.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Relieve Breast Pain:</strong><ul><li>Weaning slowly will result in less pain from engorgement. Your breasts will gradually make less milk over time from less demand. Drop the number of breast feedings gradually.</li><li>In the meantime, express just enough milk to relieve breast discomfort. Remember that complete emptying of the breast increases milk produced. Use a pump or manually express the milk for a minute or so.</li><li>Don't put your baby to the breast to relieve discomfort. Reason: They won't want to stop nursing.</li><li>A pain medicine such as ibuprofen can help.</li><li>You can also use an ice pack for 20 minutes.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Start Complete Weaning When the Time is Right for You:</strong><ul><li>Once you have made these healthy changes, you don't need to do anything more. When to wean your child is your personal choice.</li><li>Facts to Consider: After 12 months of age, nursing interactions tend to become more important to your child. After 18 months, for some children, weaning becomes harder with each passing month. </li><li>Caution: Do not start weaning if your family is under stress (such as moving).

      "HTML Column 1": "<ul><li>After 2 months, needs nursing to fall asleep</li><li>After 6 months, can't sleep 6 hours without a feeding</li><li>After 7 months, won't accept baby foods</li><li>After 9 months, won't accept a cup for some feedings</li><li>You want help with weaning</li><li>You think your child needs to be seen</li><li>You have other questions or concerns</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 2": "<p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Weaning at 9-12 Months</strong></p><ul><li>Most children normally show less interest in breastfeeding between 9 and 12 months of age. They often lose interest in the breast if they are also taking spoon feedings.</li><li>Many children wean themselves around 12 months.</li><li>For easy weaning, follow your baby's lead.</li><li>For later mother-led weaning, it needs to be done gradually.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Weaning at a Later Date after 12 Months</strong></p><ul><li>After the age of 12 months, the parent often has to start the weaning process. The child will usually be accepting.</li><li>After 18 months of age, some children may protest weaning. Reason: Breastfeeding is no longer just about hunger. It has become emotionally important to the child.</li><li>Continuing to breastfeed after 12 months is a personal decision. So is when to wean.</li><li>The AAP recommends mothers breastfeed (or use pumped milk) until 12 months. After 12 months, they recommend continued nursing &quot;if you and your baby desire it&quot;. The AAP does not recommend an upper age limit for weaning from breastfeeding.</li></ul><p class=\"rteBlock\"><strong>Prevention of Sleep Problems and Feeding Problems</strong></p><p class=\"rteBlock\">The following 2 recommendations are made to prevent potential feeding associated problems:</p><ul><li>Nursing a baby to sleep is discouraged. It interferes with learning self-soothing behavior. It will cause persistent sleep problems. Exception: first 2 months.</li><li>Comfort nursing is discouraged. Comfort nursing is very brief nursing to calm a fussy child or one who seems unhappy, but not hungry. It will make later weaning more difficult.</li><li>If your doctor or lactation advisor disagree, the choice is yours.</li></ul>\n",
      "HTML Column 3": "<div><strong>Breastfeeding During the First Month:</strong><ul><li>During the first month, expect your baby to feed every 2 to 3 hours. This is usually about 8 - 12 times/day.</li><li>During the day, awaken your baby to feed if 3 hours have passed since the last feeding.</li><li>At night, awaken to feed if 4 hours have passed since the last feeding.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Avoid Excessive Breastfeeding After the First Month:</strong><ul><li>After the first month, if your baby is gaining weight well, feed on demand (on cue). Do not feed if less than 2 hours have passed. Do not awaken for feedings.</li><li>After 2 months, do not feed if less than 3 hours have passed since the end of the last feeding. </li><li>After 6 months of age, do not feed if less than 4 hours have passed. </li><li>Keep breast feedings to 4 times a day. Be sure 3 of them are given at mealtime with baby foods (solids). </li><li>Your baby can have the fourth feeding as the first step in the bedtime ritual.</li><li>Don't nurse for between meal snacks.</li><li>Don't nurse to sleep at bedtime or naptime.</li><li>Try to stop all night feedings by 6 months.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Introduce an &quot;Educational Bottle&quot; at 1 Month:</strong><ul><li>After nursing is well established, offer a bottle of pumped breastmilk or 1 ounce of formula. In this way, your baby gets used to the bottle and the artificial nipple. Ideally, this is done soon after 4 weeks.</li><li>Frequency of bottle feedings: Start with once a day. Once your baby accepts bottle feedings, offer once every 3 days or so. Reason: Will continue to accept milk from a bottle.</li><li>If you wait too long (such as 8 weeks), some babies will reject bottle feedings. It could take several weeks to learn to accept the bottle.</li><li>Bottle acceptance allows you to leave your baby with a family member or a sitter. It's also essential if you plan on returning to work or school.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Hold Your Child for Crying not due to Hunger:</strong><ul><li>Hold and comfort your child without feeding if they are fussy and not hungry. Assume hunger is not the cause if it's been less than 2 hours since the end of the last feeding.</li><li>Unexplained fussing and crying is common in the first 3-4 months. Many babies become fussy when they need to fall asleep.</li><li>Try swaddling, gentle rocking, different sounds and other techniques. Learn what works best to soothe your baby.</li><li>If you always feed your child when fussy, you have introduced them to comfort nursing.</li><li>Your baby may also come to expect to be nursed every time they are held. That can become a habit.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Use a Pacifier When Your Baby Needs to Suck but is Not Hungry:</strong><ul><li>Some babies have a high suck drive. Learn to recognize when your baby just needs to suck.</li><li>The best way to tell is that it has been less than 2 hours since the end of the last good feeding.</li><li>At these times, offer a pacifier instead of nursing.</li><li>Feeding your baby every time he needs to suck can lead to a habit of frequent brief feeds. This makes it hard to sleep longer intervals at night.</li><li>After teeth come in, a teether may be helpful for any fussiness. </li></ul></div><div><strong>Don't Breastfeed or Hold Until Asleep:</strong><ul><li>To have a good sleeper, place your baby in the crib drowsy but still awake.</li><li>Don't breastfeed or hold until asleep. All sleep experts agree on this advice for preventing sleep problems.</li><li>Your baby needs to learn how to put themself to sleep. Self-soothing is a critical skill. If they don't, they will cry and want to be nursed after normal night wakings. This sleep problem will require your presence during the night.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Introduce a Sippy Cup at 6 Months of Age:</strong><ul><li>Exposure to cup feedings will make weaning easier.</li><li>Delaying cup feedings past 9 months makes your child less willing to try them.</li><li>At first, offer the cup after your baby has sucked some from your breast. This might be the only way your baby will accept the cup.</li><li>By 9 months of age, offer pumped milk from a cup before breast feedings. You can also use formula if that is easier.</li><li>If you stop breastfeeding after 9 months, you may be able to wean your baby directly to a cup.</li><li>Caution: If younger than 9 months, wean to a bottle and not to a cup. Most young babies can't drink well enough from a cup to get adequate nourishment.</li></ul></div><div><strong>Introduce Baby Foods (Solids) from a Spoon at 6 Months:</strong><ul><li>Starting foods earlier is not recommended for breastfed babies. It's not needed for growth and can cause gagging.</li><li>Delaying solids past 9 months runs the risk that your baby will refuse solids.</li><li>Finger foods can be introduced whenever your child develops a pincer grasp. This is usually between 9 and 10 months of age. Once your child can use finger foods, include them at the table during mealtime. Your baby will probably become interested in the foods that they see you eating. As a result, your baby will want to try other foods as well as nursing.</li></ul></div><div><strong>If You Want to Wean Your Baby at 1 Year - Helpful Tips:</strong><ul><li>Children normally show less interest in breast feedings between 9 and 12 months.</li><li>Start with any feeding when your child shows a lack of interest in the breast. Don't miss this window of opportunity for child-led weaning.</li><li>You can offer pumped breast milk or formula in a cup instead.</li><li>You can tell that your baby is ready to begin weaning when they:</li><li>Refuse the breast.</li><li>Nurse for only a few minutes and then want to play.</li><li>Become more interested in the world around them than breastfeeding.</li></ul></div>\n",

It can be video access or a favorite toy. </li><li>All children do some whining and complaining. They need a wise parent to coach them through this annoying phase. Be sure to praise them when they accept your decision without resorting to repeated pestering. </li></ul></div>\n",
